Don't speculate. Measure. In this case, you need a packet capture to
determine what is sent.

Elizabeth Gifford <azc.hecxjaq@gmail.com>,bsfegmjrr-hnq@python.org,2008-08-05 19:49:09,[spambayes-dev] I used SpamBayes for class project - thanks!,"Hi SpamBayes developers,

I just wanted to let you know that I used SpamBayes for my term 
project in my Machine Learning class, and to say thanks. I thought 
there might be some academic interest here, and that I'd share with 
the list in return for the great code of yours that I used.

The overall assignment was to ""do something with evolutionary 
algorithms."" The goal of my project was more or less to attack a 
spam filter and attempt to use an EA to find weaknesses it might 
have. I set up a blind watchmaker sort of natural selection/ 
evolution environment using a SpamBayes filter that I had trained on 
an old training corpus as the fitness function. The program I wrote 
attempted to evolve a generic formula that worked sort of like 
""MadLibs"" to write spam emails that could get past the filter. I 
started off with almost zero knowledge of how a spam filter works, 
and tried to keep it that way while I wrote the algorithm so that it 
would be as naive as possible. I've since read up on SpamBayes and 
some of the math behind it, and it looks really interesting. I'm 
looking forward to taking more time to look through the codebase.

Now that the project is completed, I see where I could have trained 
the filter on different content or parts of the evolution structure 
that I could have written differently to make this project more 
successful, but that's research for you! This was a very quick proof 
of concept project, and if I were to continue with this research 
there are certainly a lot of things I would do differently and many 
more complicated techniques that I'd like to try.

If anyone is interested in reading about the project in more detail, 
I've posted the paper I wrote here:
http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~egifford/classes/egiffordTermProject.pdf

Thanks again for maintaining this cool project. I hope you'll take 
my contribution in the intellectual sense that is intended, and not 
as an attack. :)

Liz Gifford

Your parents are lucky.

In Iraq, we had XP machines on a Department of Defence SECURE
NETWORK which was completely cut off from the rest of the
internet, and they STILL caught viruses.

We need to break the back of the mandatory bundling of Windows.
Personally, I think computers sold retail should be have line-item
costs, with Windows as a separate cost from the hardware.

It's just like payroll taxes deducted out of the paycheck --
what people don't have to explicitly fork over extra money
for, they soon forget (if they were ever aware of it in

Did this user actually authenticate? All indications are that he or she
did not. Just because the server allows authentication, does not mean
that all users correctly configure their mail clients to use it.

SPEAKER:
Stuart Ladd, System Engineer, HP Microsoft Solution Alliances



SPONSOR: 
Hewlett-Packard Company


SUMMARY:
With Exchange 2007, Microsoft was able to move away from the limitations of a 32-bit operating system with the move to a 64-bit operating system using Windows Server 2003 x 64 platforms. This allowed for significant increases in available memory resources for the application, allowing memory to scale well beyond the 4GB available to Exchange 2003; designers could now cache greater portions of the Exchange database(s) in memory.
By increasing database cache, larger portions of the user's mailbox can now be cached, reducing the I/O demands on disk.

This webcast reviews the benefits of the additional system memory in the ProLiant BL480c blade server for Exchange 2007 and details other performance considerations when working with larger memory configurations.

Did this user actually authenticate? All indications are that he or she
did not. Just because the server allows authentication, does not mean
that all users correctly configure their mail clients to use it.

Non-capturing groupings

We noted in Part 1 that groupings ""()"" had two distinct
functions: 1) group regexp elements together as a single unit, and 2)
extract, or capture, substrings that matched the regexp in the
grouping. Non-capturing groupings, denoted by ""(?:regexp)"", allow
the regexp to be treated as a single unit, but don't extract
substrings or set matching variables $1, etc. Both capturing and
non-capturing groupings are allowed to co-exist in the same
regexp. Because there is no extraction, non-capturing groupings are
faster than capturing groupings....

At this point you have probably already swapped the two processes.

I think sa-learn or the process feeding it does not like the chopping.

Don't forget that sa-learn remembers which messages have been learned. Once 
your old messages have all been learned, you need to feed to it only new 
arrivals, that is since the last sa-learn run. No need to keep 180 days worth 
of ham and spam in the temp folder!


Let sa-learn complete and then chop the folder. Just concatenate the process 
rather than schedule it in crontab. It should fix your apparent weirdness.

No. Just before my mobilization began in April 2006, I
had purchased 10.0 in the store.

Then in August 2006, after we finished our pre-deployment
training, we had a 4-day pass to go home and visit for a
bit before getting deployed... which is when I found
10.1 on the shelf (put together by some outfit like
Walnut Creek or something). I installed 10.1 in tent

conditioning!)",0,0,0

Here I go. I'm writing this notes as I go, but I'll post when I finish.


1) It is designed for an older set of libraries.

Gtk-WARNING **: Failed to load module ""libgnomebreakpad.so"": libgnomebreakpad.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

But it does exist, in ""/usr/lib/gtk-2.0/modules/libgnomebreakpad.so"". I 
guess it is looking for an older version.


2) It does not support UTF8

It displays latin1, and when I type an accented letter it displays two 
strange letters - so no utf. I had to start an xterm in latin1:

LANG=en_US.ISO-8859-1 LC_ALL=en_US.ISO-8859-1 /usr/bin/xterm -bd blue &

and from there I fire up manedit.

This could be the worst problem of all, because there is no way to edit in 
utf8 with manedit. Do you know if current man pages are supposed to be UTF 
or latin1?

[see later]

3) It is an XML editor, which it translates to troff when saving; and it 
is not WYSIWYG - but that is what you said in your write up. I'd like it 
to have a toggle to show the formatted output, but no.


4) It warns that if I enable syntax highlighting, it may crash. So far it 
hasn't, but who knows...

5) I can not even change the font size: the letters get substituted by 
squares, or I loose accents. I had to delete the configuration file to 
restore working defaults. It must be a byproduct of not supporting utf.


[...]

I haven't finished yet, but I found a blocker.

The program does it job fairly well, but the locale encoding turns out to 
be a problem.

I asked the people of the project for whom I'm translating their 
pages, whether they wanted the pages in latin1 or utf8, and the answer is 
""neither"":

] Characters outside the ASCII printable range must be encoded; see
] groff_char(7) (but note that we use ""\\('e"" rather than ""\\['e]"").


This is a problem too with manual pages in the suse distro: they either 
display well in latin 1 or in utf 8, but not both. And using the encoding 
described in groff_char(7) they display correctly in both. The blocker is 
that manedit does not support that encoding.

I would have to write ""ol\\('e"" instead of ""olÃ©"", which may be just 
a nuisance for a coder, but it is a big inconvenience for a writer: I can 
not spell check the file, and my sight doesn't see ""olÃ©"" but gibberish, so 
I can't proofread the text.

:-/

I don't understand how nobody has created a good program for writing 
documentation ""man"" files by mere mortals, not by coders. And I do 
understand now why some projects refuse altogether to create a man page 
and make do instead with html or pdf files, or why man page translations 
are so obsolete as to be useless, when they do exist.


I have also discarded (and some tried) gmanedit, gconglomerate, gjots2, 
pandoc, zoem...

I don't know what I will do. :-/

About SSL tests
---------------

An open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep
open. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a
'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the
terminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform
Subprocess Termination`).

Contributing thread:

- `About SSL tests
`__

-------------------------------------
Cross-Platform Subprocess Termination
-------------------------------------

Because os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows
platforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows
platforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.
Support was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-
platform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually
incorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was
given.

Contributing thread:

- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)

------------------------
Extended buffer protocol
------------------------

Updates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP
documenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the
plans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.

(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real
degree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants
to add to the summary, it will stay short.)

-----------------------------------------
function for counting items in a sequence
-----------------------------------------

A patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),
implemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping
between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were
suggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of
items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning
due to a just-makes-sense factor.

Contributing thread:

----------------------------------------
context manager - generator interaction?
----------------------------------------

A problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside
the with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context
manager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist
without the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of
a formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.

proposed which.py replacement

yet to be provided.

minidom and DOM level 2

----------------------------------------------
test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
----------------------------------------------

Differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose
mode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes
before a waitpid() call.

Raghuram Devarakonda <lngjjnbze@gmail.com>,Python-Dev <zvllln-eum@python.org>,2008-08-05 19:43:58,[Python-Dev] os.rename on windows,"Hi,

I have submitted a patch (http://www.python.org/sf/1704547) that
allows os.rename to replace the destination file if it exists, on
windows. As part of discussion in the tracker, Martin suggested that
python-dev should discuss the change.

Currently, os.rename() on windows uses the API MoveFile() which fails
if the destination file exists. The patch replaces this API with
MoveFileEx() and uses the flag MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING which causes
the destination file to be replaced if it exists. However, this change
is subtle and if there is any existing code that depends on current
os.rename behaviour on windows, their code is silently broken with
(any) destination file being overwritten. But the functionality of
replacing is important and I would like to know the best of way of
supporting it. If it is deemed that this change is not good to go in
as-is, how about having an optional parameter to os.rename (say,
win_replace) that can be used by callers to explicitly request
replacing?

I must also point out that the patch uses another flag
MOVEFILE_COPY_ALLOWED effectively allowing renamed files to be on
separate file systems. The renaming in this case is not atomic and I
used this flag only to support current functionality. It is not a bad
idea to disallow such renames which brings it in line with the
behaviour on many unix flavors. This also has the potential to break
code but not silently.

Lastly, I found an old discussion about the same topic by this list.

http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2001-May/014957.html

Even though Guido indicated that he doesn't support API change in this
thread, I am posting again as I did not see any one mention
MoveFileEx() in that thread.

Thanks,
Raghu.

Are you using a before-queue (smtpd_proxy) content filter?

In that case, Postfix aborts the mail transaction and will not
deliver the mail.

However, it is possible that before-queue (smtpd_proxy) content
filter does not properly handle the aborted transaction and delivers
the mail anyway. In that case, send a bug report to the content
filter maintainer.

Tell the client to fix his helo name. ""Spam-Server"" is more than non

Actually the hash of the mbox *URI*, so it's ""mailto:""+email address

Summaries
=========

---------------
About SSL tests
---------------

An open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep
open. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a
'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the
terminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform
Subprocess Termination`).

Contributing thread:

- `About SSL tests
`__

-------------------------------------
Cross-Platform Subprocess Termination
-------------------------------------

Because os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows
platforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows
platforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.
Support was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-
platform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually
incorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was
given.

Contributing thread:

- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)

------------------------
Extended buffer protocol
------------------------

Updates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP
documenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the
plans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.

(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real
degree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants
to add to the summary, it will stay short.)

Contributing threads:

- `Extended buffer PEP
`__
- `PEP 3118: Extended buffer protocol (new version)
`__
- `Extended Buffer Protocol - simple use examples
`__

-----------------------------------------
function for counting items in a sequence
-----------------------------------------

A patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),
implemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping
between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were
suggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of
items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning
due to a just-makes-sense factor.

Contributing thread:

- `function for counting items in a sequence
`__

----------------------------------------
context manager - generator interaction?
----------------------------------------

A problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside
the with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context
manager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist
without the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of
a formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.

Contributing thread:

- `context manager - generator interaction?
`__

-----------------------------
proposed which.py replacement
-----------------------------

Suggestion of replacing the which.py script in the Tools directory migrated to
its proposal for inclusion into the standard library. A patch and tests have
yet to be provided.

Contributing thread:

- `proposed which.py replacement
`_

-----------------------
minidom and DOM level 2
-----------------------

What is missing for DOM Level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and
some work jumpstarted.

Contributing thread:

- `minidom and DOM level 2
`__

----------------------------------------------
test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
----------------------------------------------

Differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose
mode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes
before a waitpid() call.

Contributing thread:

- `test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
`__

-------------------------
HTTP Responses and Errors
-------------------------

In 2xx HTTP responses mean that the request was handled OK. The
existing library was special-casing the most common responses and
treating others as errors. After verifying that there wasn't a good
reason for the old behavior, Facundo Batista fixed it.

Contributing thread:

- `HTTP responses and errors
`__

------------------------
Build Problem on Windows
------------------------

It is a generated file; the actual problem is in make_buildinfo

Contributing thread:

- `build problem on windows: unable to find getbuildinfo2.c
`__

--------------------------
BaseException Pickle Issue
--------------------------

Exceptions are now new-style classes; this caused some obscure
problems with picking and unpickling.

http://www.python.org/sf/1498571

and later

http://www.python.org/sf/1692335

should resolve the issue.

Contributing thread:

- `BaseException pickle issue
`__

---------------------------------
Deprecating BaseException.message
---------------------------------

Plans changed; BaseException will still accept an args tuple, so don't
bother with the .message attribute. Probably the shorted leaved Python
feature ever. See PEP 352.

Contributing thread:

- `deprecating BaseException.message
`__

---------------------
Changes to decimal.py
---------------------

The external standard has been updated; python's implementation will
be updated to match.

Contributing threads:

- `Changes to decimal.py
`__
- `Fwd: Re: Changes to decimal.py
`__

----------------------------------------
Pydoc Rewrite Discussion at doc-sig list
----------------------------------------

An announcement that the (normally quiet) doc-sig mailing list would
be discussing a rewrite of pydoc.
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/doc-sig/

Contributing thread:

- `Pydoc Rewrite Discussion at doc-sig list.
`__

------------------------------
Making builtins more efficient
------------------------------

Andrea Griffini posted a patch at sourceforge that makes builtin
lookups almost as fast as locals.

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=305470&aid=1616125&group_id=5470

consider the 64 bit part of the equation.

I have tried setting the Mail Domain parameter to our family's domain
name (my husband and I are the only ones accessing mail through our
own SM 1.4.13 installation),
and when I try to login without using our Domain extension, I get an
""Unknown User or Password Incorrect"" error. However, if I include our
Domain extension, I can login
without a problem.

Here are the specifics of my ISP/installation:


- SM 1.4.13, manual installation
- Installed Plugins: address_add-2.1-1.4.0, calendar_file_backend-
1.0-2.0, shared_calendars-2.0.1-1.4.0, twc_weather-1.3p3b-RC2
- PHP v4.4.4
- Web Server: Apache 1.3.37 (Unix)
- IMAP Server: IMAP c-Client Version 2004 [not sure if this is what
you need, but it is all I could find...]
- SMTP Server: Cannot locate
- OS: Linux 2.6.9-55.0.2.ELsmp
- Browsers tried: Firefox (v2.0.0.12), IE7 (v7.0.5730.11), IE6 (
v6.0.2900.2180.xpsp2_gdr.070227-2254)

I tried a search online at SourceForge going back a couple months (before
the announcement of SM1.4.13) but didn't find anything. Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance.

Gene Heskett <vvqn.qwwsabl@verizon.net>,zqoqi@spamassassin.apache.org,2008-08-05 18:36:31,sa-learn --ham ground rules,"Greetings;

About an hour ago, based on some comments made that the bayes database needed 
trained on ham as well as spam, and because it seemed to be forgetting some 
of the stuff I'd fed it as spam, I re-wrote that filter rule in kmail to 
launch it using one of my sorted directories from a mailing this as the 
argument. Syntax otherwise the same as the sa-learn-spam filter.

The sa-learn --spam can process a message in 5 to 10 seconds or so, so if I've 
dropped 20 doofus mails in the spam directory and fire it off, I have it done 
and kmail is back among the living in 2-3 minutes.

But, feeding it a 'ham' directory with about 7k messages in it, turned 
sa-learn into a 100% cpu hog, incrementing the message processed number only 
about every 3 to 5 minutes. I couldn't kill it, it kept coming back and I 
must have fed it a kill -9 50 times. Finally, one of the kills killed x too! 
But no console came back, so I had to hit the reset button. The reboot was 
like molassses in January, so I did a power down, same story. Same story 3 
times running, so I went and made a sandwich while it set powered down. Then 
the reboot was normal up to e2fscking a a 372GB drive I use for amanda, the 
backup proggy. That hung, with no indication of progress for about 20 
minutes, no marching **** or anything. But it finally fell through and 
completed the bootup, and is running normally now but it has taken the 
majority of an hour to do this.

So what is the maximum number of files in a directory that one can feed to 
sa-learn --ham and expect it to achieve normal speed? I vaguely recall 
feeding it my corpus of another folder it was having trouble with a year ago, 
the linux-usb list, 600 to 1k messages in it and it was finished in an hour 
that time.

The command that kmail issues to it is:
sa-learn --ham /root/Mail/(foldername)/cur

Where foldername is whatever mailing list I want to tell it is ham.

Is this correct? I've had it setup that way for 2 or 3 years at least and 
till now it hasn't been that much of a problem.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS) invites participation in 
the CEAS Live Spam Challenge. Participants will compete in filtering a 
live 24-hour e-mail stream delivered using standard protocols (SMTP, 
IMAP4, POP3). All types of anti-spam technology are welcome including 
servers, appliances, proxies and personal filters. Participants will be 
allowed to use any network resource including real-time blacklists, 
real-time white-lists, reverse-DNS queries, and privately owned and 
updated databases.

Simulated user-feedback will be provided to train learning-based 
filters. Filters will be evaluated based on a weighted combination of 
the percentage of spam blocked and its false positive percentage.

The challenge will be held in conjunction with the Fourth Annual 
Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS). Conference registration and 
attendance is not required for participation.

Please see http://www.ceas.cc/challenge for competition details and 
instructions on joining the competition e-mail list.

no, but you can achieve that by using restriction classes.

If the check you run is at the end of a restriction ""set"", and is simple 
enough (no map lookup in particular), you can simply order the checks 
such as in
# checks for some clients
check_client_access hash:/etc/postfix/foo_access
... [checks for other clients]

I'm not sure that will work. The SpamBayes classifier works off a token
stream which does nothing to ""hide"" the tokens. Sure, it creates a set() of
the tokens in the message, but if my phone number, email address and credit
card information are in the message they will be in the token stream as
well.

Sure. Each wiki on a single physical server might well want its own spam
classifier. Just set up the configuration bits properly (port numbers
mostly) and fire up multiple classifiers.

Elizabeth Gifford <azc.hecxjaq@gmail.com>,bsfegmjrr-hnq@python.org,2008-08-05 19:49:09,[spambayes-dev] I used SpamBayes for class project - thanks!,"Hi SpamBayes developers,

I just wanted to let you know that I used SpamBayes for my term 
project in my Machine Learning class, and to say thanks. I thought 
there might be some academic interest here, and that I'd share with 
the list in return for the great code of yours that I used.

The overall assignment was to ""do something with evolutionary 
algorithms."" The goal of my project was more or less to attack a 
spam filter and attempt to use an EA to find weaknesses it might 
have. I set up a blind watchmaker sort of natural selection/ 
evolution environment using a SpamBayes filter that I had trained on 
an old training corpus as the fitness function. The program I wrote 
attempted to evolve a generic formula that worked sort of like 
""MadLibs"" to write spam emails that could get past the filter. I 
started off with almost zero knowledge of how a spam filter works, 
and tried to keep it that way while I wrote the algorithm so that it 
would be as naive as possible. I've since read up on SpamBayes and 
some of the math behind it, and it looks really interesting. I'm 
looking forward to taking more time to look through the codebase.

Now that the project is completed, I see where I could have trained 
the filter on different content or parts of the evolution structure 
that I could have written differently to make this project more 
successful, but that's research for you! This was a very quick proof 
of concept project, and if I were to continue with this research 
there are certainly a lot of things I would do differently and many 
more complicated techniques that I'd like to try.

If anyone is interested in reading about the project in more detail, 
I've posted the paper I wrote here:
http://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~egifford/classes/egiffordTermProject.pdf

Thanks again for maintaining this cool project. I hope you'll take 
my contribution in the intellectual sense that is intended, and not 
as an attack. :)

Liz Gifford

add permit_mynetworks at the top of smtpd_sender_restrictions.

smtpd restrictions only apply to mail sent via smtp. if squirrelmail 
uses the sendmail command, then that won't work. and since squirrelmail 
always exectutes as the same user (your webserver uid), there's not much 
to do except finding a way for squirrelmail to implement the restriction.

DKIM-milter is deployed and signing and verifing mode with its primary intent to sign emails on lists.cacert.org mailing lists.

Feb 7 09:27:09 lists postfix/master[22912]: daemon started -- version 2.4.6, configuration /etc/postfix
I deployed it as a typical and sole milter

Testing on a tiny email list and the email came through signed by dkim.

Feb 7 10:28:29
an email when through to a larger email list poptem-kkrrvq@lists.cacert.org without any error

after a significant number of hours without a peep out of dkim-filter I start to get.

Feb 7 14:40:05 lists postfix/cleanup[15075]: F13C6108238: message-id=<95690946646473.5e95gt09s6@hlin.cacert.org>

These occured for these same to email recipients, every 15 minutes from until Feb 7 21:00:15 when I woke up in a haze. noticed it was failing and turned it off.
The dkim-milter still seems to be running happliy on its unix socket.

This is also noted on 
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=476123D1.5000602%40hetnet.nl
(the second error). I still can't get a total grasp of whats happing though.

Any tips on how to isolate this error would be really welcome as I really don't want to be trialing on a live system too much.

David Abrahams <wqbf@boost-consulting.com>,bsfegmjrr-hnq@python.org,2008-08-05 19:59:17,"[spambayes-dev] Near-twin ham/spam, Train-to-exhaustion, feature ideas","When I run the tte script, it always stops after 4 or 5 rounds. If it
goes beyond 6 rounds it's a sure sign that I've misclassified
something (**). What I do then is run the script with -v and let it
show me the messages it's training on. In later runs it's always
training one or two messages that are the culprits. I just look for
those message IDs in TBird and move them into the right training sets.

I do this training automatically on my server, so what I'd like to do
is have the script automatically email me a notice identifying problem
messages in my training set. Maybe it should even mark them deleted
(I use IMAP) and restart the process. Thoughts?

(**) Technically speaking, running for 6 or more rounds doesn't
necessarily identify a misclassification. Sometimes it identifies a
correctly-classified message for which there is an
oppositely-classified near-twin. Today, it had some trouble with a
""correctly"" classified-as-ham Mailman moderation request message
containing a piece of spam that I had also received directly and thus
classified as spam. So everything was classified ""correctly."" What
prompted me to look at this situation was that lots of ham started
falling into my ""unsure"" folder today. So despite the fact that
everything was classified correctly, overall performance was
noticeably reduced. I'm tempted to conclude that TTE running for more
than 5 rounds just indicates a classification that's bad for
performance.

I guess my next question is whether this near-twin classification (the
difference being that one of the messages was a moderation request) is
supposed to work well? I guess if I have some other moderation
requests in my spam folder that could really confuse things... hmm,
straightened that out and it still didn't finish training speedily.

You are right. I just checked cygwin's rename() code and it is
convincing enough for me to withdraw the patch.

Thanks for all the comments.

Well, the destruction technically happens *after* the undef
instruction has finished. So the current COP points at the next
statement. Which might be far away... or might even not have a line
number associated to it. That happens if the undef() call is done at
the end of an END block.

I understand that might be not practical, but that's the first time I
hear about this problem and I don't have really an idea about a
possible and efficient solution.",0,0,0

Indirectly. Use a transport_maps entry to deliver mail through a
non-default mail delivery transport in master.cf, then set a
(transport name)_destination_concurrency_limit for that.

Just clone the ""smtp ... smtp"" line and give it a different
name in the first field, then ""postfix reload"".

The current QSHAPE_README file has examples.

guidelines. This is an interim report. We should have the final
guidelines by the end of June. In the meantime, please feel 
free to post queries or comments to this list.

The primary tasks will use the same tool kit and data format as
last year; i.e. the TREC spam filter evaluation toolkit available
here:

http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/spam/

The active learning task will use a different version of the 
toolkit, to be available shortly.

The three tasks are:

On-line filtering with immediate feedback. 
- exactly the same task as for TREC 2005 and 2006

On-line filtering with delayed/incomplete/noisy feedback.
- same tools as for the TREC 2006 delayted feedback,
but the test data may not contain ""train"" commands
for every message, and some of the ""train"" commands
may be wrong so as to simulate user underreporting
and user error.

Emphasis will be placed on correct classification
of a large number of messages with no feedback.
(For example, there may be no feedback for the
last half of the messages)

On-line active filtering with active learning.
- different tools and task from TREC 2006 active learning
Filters will perform on-line classification as for the
other two tasks, but will be allowed to query the
true class (ham or spam) of a fraction of the messages,
chosen by the filter. This will be effected by an
additional command ""query"" added to the toolkit:

query 

where is a message previously classified
by the filter. 


Filters will be submitted to NIST (date to be determined, but
probably mid-July) after which a public corpus will be released.
Results on the public corpus will also be submitted to NIST
(probably late August).

+1 to switching, and +1 to doing it now. This reason (diffing 
offline) is really the only noticeable difference for me, with the 
limited way that I use CVS/SVN, but it's a huge benefit (not just to

not sure at the moment if its better to pull them into one summary or
three. I would think one, with all the cross over that happens these

Even though MSDN docs do not say it explicitly, I found some
discussions claiming that MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING is atomic.
However, after seeing your comment, I did a more thorough search and I
too found some references claiming otherwise. As a last resort, I
checked cygwin documentation which claims that it's rename() is
POSIX.1 compliant. If I am not mistaken, POSIX.1 does require
atomicity so I am curious how rename() is implemented there. I checked
out the sources and I will try to find more about their
implementation.

I completely agree that without positive proof of atomicity, there is
no point in making this code change.

> Also, I assume this cannot replace files that are in use?

A simple test shows that it can indeed replace files that are open.

In this case it's a single directory yes, but i've generalized it to 
'fix unsafe paths' on VMS.
What would be the proper way to reconstruct the path after the '/' 
trick on VMS?

Of course you need to find the right words... Be helpful and firm. Tell 
them:
- you will whitelist them (so you're very open)
- but you don't want anyone else to be whitelisted. so they must own the IP
- they must take responsibility for all mail coming out of that IP
- they may have delivery issues elsewhere. they may not realize it, but 
some sites may be discarding their mail. And if that didn't happen yet, 
chances are this will happen in the future. Many people are getting sick 
of supporting zombies because of broken sites.

In short, their system is not configured according to the standards:
- a helo name must be an fqdn hostname (or an IP literal)
- their system must have a correct reverse DNS: IP->name->IP must result 
in the original IP.

It would have been easier if you showed your config. you need to put a 
check_client_access that returns OK but you must not put this in the 
wrong place.

here is an acceptable example:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
...

be able to add the broken_client check before it without affecting other 
checks.

a less appealing alternative is to make your reject_non_fqdn_hostname a 
result of a check_client_access:

Elizabeth Mattijsen <ifk@dijkmat.nl>,qtog3-epoawmh@perl.org,2008-08-06 1:39:46,caller() info in DESTROY off?,"While investigating some issues with regards to object destruction, I 
came upon this little oddity. Take this program:

= foo ================================================
sub Foo::DESTROY {
(undef, $filename, $line) = caller;
print ""called from $filename, line $line\\n""
}

my $foo = bless {}, 'Foo';
undef $foo; # destruction *not* reported at this line

my $bar; # line at which destruction of object is reported
======================================================

If you run this, you get:

called from foo, line 9


It seems that the caller info is pointing to the next ""executable"" 
line (line 9), rather than where the actual destruction is taking 
place (line 7). Well, at least where the destruction is taking place 
from a ""naive"" user's point of view. ;-)


I assume this is basically the way it is, right? Seems to be like 
this in every version of Perl I could get my hands on.

In this case it's a single directory yes, but i've generalized it to 
'fix unsafe paths' on VMS.
What would be the proper way to reconstruct the path after the '/' 
trick on VMS?

Re: Does anyone know anyting about Dr. Myur Srikanth in Federal Way, Posted by: ""Dina"" dbcspbwm@comcast.net dinamcb Thu Feb 7, 2008 6:07 am (PST) Here's a search from this group about previous posts relating to the doctor: http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/duodenalswitch/msearch?query=Srikanth &pos=20&cnt=10 Last I heard he was working with Dr. Oh and was not enthusiastically offering the DS. (I spoke with a lady who had a consult with him who was set on the DS - he did a pretty aggressive sell on distal RNY to her. She ended up choosing a different surgeon.) That's been quite some time ago now, though. The list at www.duodenalswitch.com is the list of surgeons I would consider sound. There are a lot of surgeons who will put themselves out there as doing the DS or having been trained in it - when they truly are not pro-DS at all. OH's list is notorious for those types of listings. I know they tried to clean the list up a bit about a year ago or so, but it's still concerning to me that so many people get fed a TON of misinformation about the DS when they contact some of those listed there! Maybe it would be a good idea to call their office and ask some pointed questions: 1. Does the doctor offer the DS as a surgical procedure? 2. If so, how many DS surgeries has he done (total)? 3. How many open? How many lap? 4. How many Lap DS surgeries has he done in the past year? 5. How many surgeries that started out Lap were converted to open? 6. What type of post-op follow-up does he have for DS post-ops? 7. How many of his DS post-ops are willing to speak to prospective patients? 8. Can he share information about his feelings about surgical specs? (I.e., what size gastric sleeve does he leave? What length alimentary limb? What length common channel?) Just to name a few.

Re: Does anyone know anyting about Dr. Myur Srikanth in Federal Way, Posted by: ""Jill"" ralmvdz@gmail.com jillnaeseth Thu Feb 7, 2008 10:35 pm (PST) I had heard that Dr. Srikanth was going to be moving to a practice through Evergreen Hospital in Kirkland. It's my understanding that he's not working with Dr. Oh any longer. He had done more than a few DS when he was practicing in California and I had heard he was not opposed to the DS, and had wondered why so few folks in Washington were interested in the DS. I think he's done more DS, sure not certain about the lap numbers, though. Washington could sure use a good DS surgeon that was regularly performing the DS, that's for sure!

Both myself and a coworker had the same problem on our new Dell Latitude
D630 laptops. Fresh installs of 10.3. 

We could see an access point but could not connect the majority of the
time. When we were able to connect, signal strength in the Gnome Network
Manager applet would be in the low teens, speed would never be above 24
Mbs and overall performance would be extremely poor. 

After much troubleshoot I discovered that during installation both the
ipw3945 and the iwl3945 kernel modules got installed. Yast chose the
ipw3945 module when setting up the wireless. From some of the messages
I've seen when Googleing Intel 3945, there seem to be some significant
issues with the ipw3945 kernel driver. 

The fix is to in YAST, select Configure on the Wireless Card. Select the
Hardware Tab, then change the Kernel Module in the Module Name Drop down
list from the ipw3945 to the iwl3945. Save the settings and exit out of
YAST. Reboot the laptop. 

If the iwl3945 kernel module is not in the list install it first then
reboot and change.

According to the chatter, some of the features of the iwl3945 module are
done yet. Like illuminating the blue Wifi light and displaying the
connection speed in the Network manager. But other than those cosmetic
issues, it is reliable and works every time I boot. I have no trouble
going between the office wireless and my home wireless, or using any
other wifi connection I have tried. 

Give it shot and let us know how it works.",0,0,0

Funny thing. I have an IBM ThinkPad R31 notebook that came with WiFi. 
The original 802.11b card had WPA support in Linux, but not Windows. I
then upgraded to a b/g card. Now Windows will support WPA, but not WPA2
that Linux on that same computer supports. In order to get WPA2 in XP,
I have to download an update from MS, but getting that update requires
installing ""Windows Genuine Advantage"" spyware. So, this computer will
only be doing WPA on the rare occasions I use Windows with it, while
Linux will be WPA2. My Nokia N800 also does WPA2.
