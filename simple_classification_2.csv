Here's something I just found and points to where the ""real"" problem 
with hidden sites is, when for awhile I assumed it was 
KNetworkmanager....so did others.

For almost 2 weeks, I've been using the ipw3945 driver and the standard 
ifup method to connect. I just changed from that driver to the iwl3945 
driver, stopped the ipw driver and used Yast to setup using the iwl 
driver with KNetworkmanager.....just to see what happend. I've NOT been 
able to see hidden sites, including my own at home, with 
KNetworkmanager.......now I can.

So, it would appear that this problem that plagues some others with 
different chipsets have a problem with the driver, NOT KNetworkmanager.

Thanks to Chuck Stuettgen for pointing this out!!

At this point you have probably already swapped the two processes.

I think sa-learn or the process feeding it does not like the chopping.

Don't forget that sa-learn remembers which messages have been learned. Once 
your old messages have all been learned, you need to feed to it only new 
arrivals, that is since the last sa-learn run. No need to keep 180 days worth 
of ham and spam in the temp folder!


Let sa-learn complete and then chop the folder. Just concatenate the process 
rather than schedule it in crontab. It should fix your apparent weirdness.

Once you know that it may be possible to decode the pattern to discover what is being found in your logwatch mail. It may also be possible to instruct your system to not scan mail from logwatch. dp ------------------------------ >From buddgrbonu@gmail.com Sun Feb 24 10:27:38 2008 Message: 5 Date: Thu, 07 Feb 2008 16:20:40 +0200 From: T?r?k Edwin Subject: Re: [Clamav-users] Clamdscan not find viruses To: ClamAV users ML Message-ID: <47AB13B8.1020406@gmail.com> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=ISO-8859-1 Rick Macdougall wrote: > Hi, > > I have another example where clamdscan fails to find a virus but > clamscan does. > > > I have a copy of the message in question if one of the devs would like a > copy. > > Please open a bugreport, and attach the sample (marked as private).

PhishingScanURLs was no (hard coded), changing it to yes makes clamdscan see it. How ever the reason I saw it was because a message came in on mail server 3 last night and was not caught, but the message was then forwarded to a user on mail server 2 where it was rejected by clamdscan. Now, mail server 2 did not see the virus this morning when I checked it again but it obviously did last night when PhishingScanURLs = no. Any reason for that that you can see ?

The cygwin implementation of rename goes like this:

1) Try to use MoveFile
2) Try to use MoveFileEx(..., MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)
3) Try to unlink destination, then try to use MoveFile

And as you say, Cygwin claims it meets POSIX.1. And, POSIX.1 says, ""If 
newpath already exists it will be atomically replaced (subject to
a few conditions; see ERRORS below), so that there is no point at which 
another process attempting to access newpath will find it missing."" 
Clearly, unliking and then calling MoveFile is not atomic. So, cygwin is 
not being honest here because in these less frequent cases, the rename 
will not be atomic.

Also note, MVCRT only tries step 1 of cygwin's version. Which I believe 
also suggests that it's the only version that is atomic.

Postfix sees end-of-message ("".""). Premature EOF longjmps() out of the
data input loop and aborts delivery, so it is rather unlikely that "".""

You are not showing *network* traffic, so this is not that illuminating.

Not trying to be an a--hole, but if you're using SLES you should be using 
Novell support. If you're not paying for support with SLES, then you would 
probably be better off using something different.

This ML is specific to openSUSE, though having said that I must admit I'm not 
sure of what you're problem could be, so I am intrigued.

Could be someone else will post a suggestion, but really, this isn't really 
the proper forum for support.

It is not the client hostname that is rejected, it's the helo name that the 
client itself determines to announces itself to the receiving server.

This is especially stupid since you have to configure the helo of your own system.

So you can only kick the admin of the server with the non-fqdn-helo or 
whitelist the client.

No.

The problem is, that if you enable such access, your VM (virtual
machine) will no longer be isolated, so the code will leak, and it may
destroy data on your host (physical PC).
This is very unsafe.

master.cf; 10026 is the last of three smtpd listeners:

:10026 inet n - n - 50 smtpd
-o content_filter=
-o smtpd_client_restrictions=
-o smtpd_helo_restrictions=
-o smtpd_sender_restrictions=
-o smtpd_error_sleep_time=0
-o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
-o receive_override_options=no_unknown_recipient_checks
-o smtpd_milters=inet:localhost:10004
-o disable_mime_output_conversion=yes
-o milter_macro_daemon_name=ORIGINATING
-o milter_default_action=accept

Default milter_protocol is 3 (6 as advised for PF 2.5 *does* give 
SMFIC_HEADER faults).

milter_macro_daemon_name corresponds to 'MTA ORIGINATING' in 
/etc/dkim-filter.conf - even though people have written that that's not 
necessary any more with current versions of dkim-milter.

Best,

came upon this little oddity. Take this program:

= foo ================================================
sub Foo::DESTROY {
(undef, $filename, $line) = caller;
print ""called from $filename, line $line\\n""
}

my $foo = bless {}, 'Foo';
undef $foo; # destruction *not* reported at this line

my $bar; # line at which destruction of object is reported
======================================================

If you run this, you get:

called from foo, line 9


It seems that the caller info is pointing to the next ""executable"" 
line (line 9), rather than where the actual destruction is taking 
place (line 7). Well, at least where the destruction is taking place 
from a ""naive"" user's point of view. ;-)


I assume this is basically the way it is, right? Seems to be like 
this in every version of Perl I could get my hands on.

thanks for your effort!

To compile on recent Gentoo systems, ext/IPC/SysV/SysV.xs needs
some tweakage. In blead, this was fixed by change #31702. However,
this doesn't work for 5.005, as HAS_GETPAGESIZE and HAS_SYSCONF
are not determined by Configure.

I'm pretty confident that the include isn't needed
on Linux. I've been testing this with a vanilla RedHat installs
back to RH 5.2 (Linux 2.0.36 #1 Tue Oct 13 22:17:11 EDT 1998),
and they work fine without the header. But there may be be some
platform dependency, so I think a safe approach would be to
remove the include for x86-Linux only. Here's a patch:


--- perl5.005_05-MAINT20070902/ext/IPC/SysV/SysV.xs 2007-05-31 16:59:31000000000 +0200
+++ perl5.005_05-MAINT20070902-mhx/ext/IPC/SysV/SysV.xs 2007-10-03 14:57:38000000000 +0200
@@ -3,7 +3,7 @@
#include ""XSUB.h""

#include 
-#ifdef __linux__
+#if defined(__linux__) && !defined(__i386__)
# include 
#endif
#if defined(HAS_MSG) || defined(HAS_SEM) || defined(HAS_SHM)


With this, all tests pass on all my Linux systems.

Actually the hash of the mbox *URI*, so it's ""mailto:""+email address

Subject: Re: NorthTec Account/Password

This still doesn't work.

The ""not used before"" can't be relevant here, because this is a
completely new account.
In case the initial setup was triggering the ""previous 24 hours"", I
didn't do anything with it yesterday and tried today, so that can't be
relevant.

The password ""ABcd23."" is exactly 7 characters long, has a mixture of
uppercase, lowercase, and symbols, doesn't include my name, and isn't
accepted. (This isn't the password I would prefer to use, but it's an
example of one that doesn't work, but matches what you said).

The error I get is:

""""""
The password supplied does not meet the minimum complexity
requirements. Please try again.
Your password has expired and must be changed. Please change your
password now.
""""""

It seems clear that the username must be correct, otherwise it
wouldn't be telling me that it has expired.

Any further suggestions?

Thanks,
Tony

if you haven't yet seen previous BBC articles, the intent is to bring
the bleeding edge perl people together with those whose modules on
CPAN suffer from expected changes in the next version of perl. You may
not be amused by the fact that your module has an issue with
bleadperl, but chances are good that the problem can be resolved
before 5.10 comes out if only somebody chimes in to explain what's the
issue.

See the facts. Somehow your code triggers a different behaviour of
perl since patch 26487

(http://public.activestate.com/cgi-bin/perlbrowse/p/26487)
Change 26487 by nicholas@nicholas-saigo on 2005/12/26 12:31:01

Rework constant.pm to take advantage of the space savings of proxy
constant subroutines whenever it can.

which leads to a test failure:

t/37-translator-graph......Can't locate object method ""is_trivial_link"" via package ""GLOB"" at /home/sand/.cpan/build/SQL-Translator-0.08001-oWjySe/blib/lib/SQL/Translator/Schema/Graph.pm line 46.
# Looks like you planned 3 tests but only ran 2.
# Looks like your test died just after 2.
dubious
Test returned status 255 (wstat 65280, 0xff00)
DIED. FAILED test 3
Failed 1/3 tests, 66.67% okay

I had no success when I tried to reduce the bug to a small testcase,
sorry.

Maybe Nicholas will follow up with an explanation what is happening?

Hope this helps,
--

i've installed the Plugin image_buttons-1.4-1.4 on squirrelmail 
1.4.9a-2.

everything works fine.

Now I only want to adjust the Webinterface, because when I move the 
Mouse over a button like 'Compose' or 'Addresses',
the right frame isn't fixed, so the hole right frame goes up and down 
when i move the mouse over the buttons.

I made some tests/adjustments in the file /path/to/squirrelmail/ 
functions/page_header.php, but without success.

Are there any hints available?

Thanks in advance

Their server identifies itself as ns.ky3.com, but DNS resolves 
ns.ky3.com to 208.183.224.88 which in turn resolves to 
cmscache.clickability.com.

ns.ky3.com has address 208.184.224.88
88.224.184.208.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer cmscache.clickability.com.

If I was in your shoes, I would tell them that the problem is that their 
end, they should fix their DNS entry or the HELO on their server. The 
moment you ""break"" your server to accommodate people who have configured 
things wrong, you are asking for trouble in ways you may not anticipate.

FROM THE EDITOR


Podcast update: Threats and trends for 2008
[Maggie Wright, Assistant Editor]
rybamlk@techtarget.com

Per usual, we have several new and interesting audio downloads for you this month, highlighting topics such as malware, network access control and the threat landscape for 2008. 

Malware has been a hot topic in '08. Nugache, sophisticated rootkits and ransomware have all made headlines. Now, after quietly falling off the radar, PDF spam could be making a comeback. Last week, MX Logic, an antispam and managed services vendor, reported that it is tracking PDF spam found in unwanted messages. As part of our Seacurity Wire Weekly podcast series, Sam Masiello, director of threat
management at MX Logic, offered his opinions on why the format has resurfaced, how security researchers found it and whether an increase in PDF spam is likely. Also, security researchers at Facetime Communications warn of a new do-it-yourself phishing program that assists phishers in attacking social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook.

The network access control (NAC) market was the topic of choice in our Jan. 23rd Security Wire Weekly edition. Dave Bixler, CISO for Siemens IT Solutions and Services, talks about the state of the network access control market, where NAC technology is headed and why he thinks it's smart for organizations to hold off on NAC deployments. 

In our first Security Squad podcast of the New Year, the SearchSecurity.com editors discussed the likelihood of a massive cyberattack in 2008. The team also examines the Sears spyware scandal. 

In last month's Threat Monitor podcast, security threats expert Ed Skoudis unveiled what he thinks will be the biggest security threats in 2008, and offers advice on how corporations can defend against them. Some of the threats mentioned include spear-phishing, botnets and malware email attacks. 

Be sure to check out our brand-new Compliance School podcast, Fact or fiction: Involving end users in the compliance program. Richard E. Mackey, vice president of consultancy SystemExperts, discloses the tools needed to educate end users about the importance of compliance, how users can get involved in the compliance program and why compliance is an essential aspect of corporate risk management.

We're adding new recordings all the time, so remember, you can visit our audio downloads page at any time to listen to all of our security podcasts and subscribe to our podcast feeds.

Have a great weekend!

I always keep a second small installation in a separate partition, for 
emergencies.

Better let each install do it's own grub into its root or boot partition, 
not the mbr. That way they don't collide.

This seems *way* too high. If there have been only 20 messages total in
that folder, sa-learn should have processed these in a few *seconds* or
less.

What did you expect? Based on your numbers above, processing that folder
would have taken 10-20 *hours*...

Hmm. Kmail doesn't start one process per mail by any chance?

Dunno if there are limitations -- however, your 7k messages should be
perfectly fine. Just ran a test on a 6k messages mbox file, and there
was no noticeable difference to a 30 messages test.


> The command that kmail issues to it is:

Hi. Most likely this is a case of overfitting (overtraining): (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting): ""especially in cases where learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare, the learner may adjust to very specific random features of the training data, that have no causal relation to the target function."" Overfitting in back-propagation neural networks like MLP (resulting in prediction bias toward one/some of the target classes) can be caused by the following: if misclassified training instances continue to be misclassified iteration after iteration, they get overweighted and actually take weight from the correctly classified instances, i.e. the weights become imbalanced. Furthermore, if misclassified instances happen to be clearly concentrated to some classes, this can result in confusion matrix that you quoted (zero correct instances for some classes). > I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this. MLP describes the parameters as follows: ""learningRate -- The amount the weights are updated. momentum -- Momentum applied to the weights during updating. decay -- This will cause the learning rate to decrease. This will divide the starting learning rate by the epoch number, to determine what the current learning rate should be. This may help to stop the network from diverging from the target output, as well as improve general performance."" As far as I know, no off-the-shelf formula exists for optimizing these parameters. It is an interchange of parameters and the dataset. If you are looking for a pattern in performance, consider that the parameters operate together (learning rate * momentum / decay) so that the first two operate for controlling speed of change and the latter for stopping the change. ""Ultimately, the cost function will depend on the task we wish to perform."" (wiki). If you are getting as high as > 85% accuracies from most configurations, this suggests that optimal training model for this dataset is produced when the parameters are set on 'fast burn' (few iterations) so I would say higher learning rate * momentum and fast decay work best (do they?).

There is a setting somewhere, I don't know where, but it is about 300 
secs or 5 mins. of inactivity. If I'm going away for a moment or two, 
just start tailf /var/log/mail (if a mail server) or tailf 
/var/log/messages if you have some syslog activity and that will hold 
the connection until you get back;

Another, ""more proper"" way to do it is to use ""screen"", the detach the 
session, leave it running, and then reattach when necessary. Note, this 
doesn't save a lot of keystrokes, but if you have a process on a remote 
system you need to leave running, either screen or backgrounding the 
process makes the most sense. See man screen (basically just type screen 
in any terminal, then ctrl-a h and choose detach or ctrl-a d.

If he sent e-mail to me, my server would also reject it, then you would 
not be alone. But seriously, I wonder if setting up /etc/nsswitch.conf 
to check ""files"" first and adding an entry to /etc/hosts would fix it e.g.

64.22.240.195 ns.ky3.com

I am not sure how postfix verifies fqdn, if it uses the OS resolver 
stack or some other method.

I know aliases works but what about but I would really like to forward 
all mail from all users and services, new and old, to automatically 
forward to a central e-mail server which will deliver the account mail

The book and practice seems to be out of phase :-)

It is simple to create new user(s). They are by default administrators (well, 
elevated rights), so that has to be fixed manually.

Goutam Baul <uelsuu.cjgy@cesc.co.in>,rljdsng-xyqoh@postfix.org,2008-08-06 5:12:35,Mail Sending problem,"Hello Everybody,

I am using RHEL 4 with postfix postfix-2.2.10-1.RHEL4.2. The authentication
is being done using openldap and courier packages are being used for pop and
imap. Maildrop is the mail delivery agent. The packages details are given
below:

I have implemented SASL authetication. Trend Micro Net Suit is being used as
the anti spam/anti virus software. Since last few days I am finding that
some of the users (out of total 900+ users 3 has reported the issue so far)
are not able to send mail to any address outside of my domain. The log entry
that I am getting is something like

Feb 8 15:54:29 mail postfix/smtpd[9334]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from
unknown[59.183.54.228]: 554 : Recipient address
rejected: Access denied; from=
to= proto=SMTP helo=

>From the log I can see that many mails are getting delivered to outside
domains without any problems. But the users who are getting the problem are
not able to send any mail to outside world. But these same users are able to
send mail to anyplace when they use IMAP. For web interface I am using
squirrelmail.

The Japanese eat very little fat and suffer fewer heart attacks than the
British or the Americans.

On the other hand, the French eat a lot of fat and also suffer fewer heart
attacks than the British or the Americans.

The Japanese drink very little red wine and suffer fewer heart attacks than
the British or the Americans.

The Italians drink excessive amounts of red wine and also suffer fewer heart
attacks than the British or the Americans.

Conclusion: Eat and drink whatever you like. It's speaking English that
kills you.

Even though MSDN docs do not say it explicitly, I found some
discussions claiming that MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING is atomic.
However, after seeing your comment, I did a more thorough search and I
too found some references claiming otherwise. As a last resort, I
checked cygwin documentation which claims that it's rename() is
POSIX.1 compliant. If I am not mistaken, POSIX.1 does require
atomicity so I am curious how rename() is implemented there. I checked
out the sources and I will try to find more about their
implementation.

I completely agree that without positive proof of atomicity, there is
no point in making this code change.

> Also, I assume this cannot replace files that are in use?

A simple test shows that it can indeed replace files that are open.

installed by yast, and have nothing to complain), one can try the 
other if necessary :-))

thanks

the shellscript part was a different attempt to make it work, as the 
perl code always says ""0 messages"", when it's not true. I thought it was 
something about permissions, and the shellscript part just confirmed 
that. Alls the perl vars, including $mailbox contain the right value.

I've tried different owners for the .pl file and all kind of 
permissions, including suid, and perl always says 0 and shell always 
says permission denied.

What about permissions? is vmail user ok for the filter? what 
combination of permissions i have to set up to make it work?

Thanks.

Indirectly. Use a transport_maps entry to deliver mail through a
non-default mail delivery transport in master.cf, then set a
(transport name)_destination_concurrency_limit for that.

Just clone the ""smtp ... smtp"" line and give it a different
name in the first field, then ""postfix reload"".

The current QSHAPE_README file has examples.

Very interesting. After a lot of googling, jHylafax never turned up. But 
now I know why SUSEfax has been a decade without update -- it morphed to 
jHylaFax. Since the SUSEfax page still exists at Sourceforge, on the 
other hand, one wonders why its developer hasn't thought to put a single 
sentence in it to point to jHylaFax. I do have a thought about that, but 
this isn't the place for it.

Thank you much for your information.

Initial Comment:
reference to http://mail.python.org/pipermail/spambayes-dev/2007-March/003870.html

""spambayes binary 1.1a3 fails to install,Error 500 +
database hangs""

I think this can be attributed (even in 1.1a4) to the line

spambayes.message.Message.message_info_db = None (sb_server.py 801 in
1.1a4)

If i change it to
spambayes.message.Message().message_info_db = None
everything is fine for me.

It's also not clear to me, why State().close() is not called for all
spambayes instances, but only for me and the error reports you mention.

I believe you're correct. I had already found and fixed this in
the new core_server.py application. I checked in the change you
suggested (sb_server.py 1.52). I marked this ticket pending and
assigned to Tony as he indicated that he hoped to cut an Outlook
installer release in the next couple days.

I'm not sure what your last statement about State().close()
refers to. Can you elaborate?

Thanks,

I would be very interested in where you got this info from. Or perhaps

I recently formatted my hp pavillion(s7720.uk) in order to reinstall xp on
it. (Vista was driving me round the bend).
I'm not sure my machine was intended to run anything other than vista. Now
that I've installed xp on it I am missing certain drivers. \\most importantly
\\i cannot connect it to the internet which means I cannot easily search for
drivers.

at present I'm missing drivers for -
Other PCI Bridge Device
PCI Device
SM Bus Controller
Video Controller

What I'm hoping for is that one of you is a hp expert and could help me sort
this out. I'm used to Dell machines so this is proving to be a royal pain in
the $%^ at the moment. To top it off the only other machine in the house is
my italian flatmates spyware ridden piece of shit, wich means saving my own
machine is further complicated.

all help appreciated!

If you look in regcomp in pregcomp (i think) you can find code the

According to the info he gives in his OH profile, he's only done 10 lap
DSs:

http://www.obesityhelp.com/morbidobesity/bariatric+surgeon+profile+Myur+\\
Srikanth+jjl.html
<http://www.obesityhelp.com/morbidobesity/bariatric+surgeon+profile+Myur\\
+Srikanth+jjl.html>

But it doesn't say when he gave that info, so he may have done more by
now. You might want to post the question on the DS forum at OH. It's a
very active board with a lot of people who live in WA. I think I
remember seeing a couple of people who had their DS with him, but I'm
not 100% sure.

The old DS rule seems to apply here. I would let a lap DS surgeon get 50 procedures under his belt before I would put myself at his mercy. Let someone else be the trial dummies. Get someone experienced.

Here's a search from this group about previous posts relating to the doctor:

http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/duodenalswitch/msearch?query=Srikanth
<http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/duodenalswitch/msearch?query=Srikanth&
pos=20&cnt=10> &pos=20&cnt=10

Last I heard he was working with Dr. Oh and was not enthusiastically
offering the DS. (I spoke with a lady who had a consult with him who was
set on the DS - he did a pretty aggressive sell on distal RNY to her. She
ended up choosing a different surgeon.) That's been quite some time ago
now, though.

The list at www.duodenalswitch.com <http://www.duodenalswitch.com/> is the
list of surgeons I would consider sound. There are a lot of surgeons who
will put themselves out there as doing the DS or having been trained in it -
when they truly are not pro-DS at all. OH's list is notorious for those
types of listings. I know they tried to clean the list up a bit about a
year ago or so, but it's still concerning to me that so many people get fed
a TON of misinformation about the DS when they contact some of those listed
there!

Maybe it would be a good idea to call their office and ask some pointed
questions:

1. Does the doctor offer the DS as a surgical procedure?
2. If so, how many DS surgeries has he done (total)?
3. How many open? How many lap?
4. How many Lap DS surgeries has he done in the past year?
5. How many surgeries that started out Lap were converted to open?
6. What type of post-op follow-up does he have for DS post-ops?
7. How many of his DS post-ops are willing to speak to prospective
patients?
8. Can he share information about his feelings about surgical specs?
(I.e., what size gastric sleeve does he leave? What length alimentary limb?
What length common channel?)

Just to name a few.

Best of luck,

dina

Maybe but I was my surgeons 2nd lap DS and all went off without a hitch. I think it is much more important to find out how good your surgeon is as opposed to how my procedures they have done.

I had heard that Dr. Srikanth was going to be moving to a practice through
Evergreen Hospital in Kirkland. It's my understanding that he's not working
with Dr. Oh any longer. He had done more than a few DS when he was
practicing in California and I had heard he was not opposed to the DS, and
had wondered why so few folks in Washington were interested in the DS.

I think he's done more DS, sure not certain about the lap numbers, though.
Washington could sure use a good DS surgeon that was regularly performing
the DS, that's for sure!

It is not the client hostname that is rejected, it's the helo name that the 
client itself determines to announces itself to the receiving server.

This is especially stupid since you have to configure the helo of your own system.

So you can only kick the admin of the server with the non-fqdn-helo or 
whitelist the client.

Of course you need to find the right words... Be helpful and firm. Tell 
them:
- you will whitelist them (so you're very open)
- but you don't want anyone else to be whitelisted. so they must own the IP
- they must take responsibility for all mail coming out of that IP
- they may have delivery issues elsewhere. they may not realize it, but 
some sites may be discarding their mail. And if that didn't happen yet, 
chances are this will happen in the future. Many people are getting sick 
of supporting zombies because of broken sites.

In short, their system is not configured according to the standards:
- a helo name must be an fqdn hostname (or an IP literal)
- their system must have a correct reverse DNS: IP->name->IP must result 
in the original IP.

It would have been easier if you showed your config. you need to put a 
check_client_access that returns OK but you must not put this in the 
wrong place.

here is an acceptable example:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
...
reject_unauth_destination
reject_non_fqdn_sender
reject_non_fqdn_recipient
...
reject_invalid_hostname
check_client_access cidr:/etc/postfix/broken_client
reject_non_fqdn_hostname
...


== broken_client
10.1.2.3/32 OK


In short, you should move your reject_non_fqdn_hostname down enough to 
be able to add the broken_client check before it without affecting other 
checks.

a less appealing alternative is to make your reject_non_fqdn_hostname a 
result of a check_client_access:

==
10.1.2.3/32 DUNNO
0.0.0.0/0 reject_non_fqdn_hostname

but this will only add complexity.",0,0,0

It's all a usability (http://www.useit.com/alertbox/) problem. You
might say SpamAssassin is usability exempt, as it is only for computer
pros. But I'm here to give valuable insights of how SpamAssassin looks
to we lesser programmers. Just want to let you know. Can't help. Gotta go.

Anyway, assuming the user guesses correctly the special world of
SpamAssassin version numbers, the UPGRADE file still doesn't mention
anything beyond 3.2.0.

So it should mention all that. Or better yet see how MediaWiki
packages their upgrade instructions.

Naw, else it wouldn't say
$ head ~/etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf

No. don't break your system to try fixing that of someone else. Instead:
- use the opportunity to put ""pressure""
- whitelist his IP
