Nowhere have I said anything about not being able to create new users.

All the above quote is stating is, ""....bestows Administrative rights on 
*anyone* [my emphasis] who logs into the computer,...."".

What you write is, of course, all very exciting - except that for the 
Joe-in-the-street who buys a copy of the Home edition (AND Professional, 
BTW) will not have a damn clue that you need to use the OS as a user 
with NO Administrator privileges.

Which is why openSUSE was created.

And this after I pointed out the same problem with another directory 
to Mark just a few weeks ago :) I believe this is fixed now - ping 
me again if it isn't.

Unless Mark beats me to it, I should be able to do this in a day or 
two (assuming the changes he made to py2exe removing the requirement 
for Outlook 2000 work!).

I'll also check the .zip file at the same time, but I'm pretty sure 
we never had a problem with ones that Anthony did, so it should be fine.

Tony

b <- ""stbA::cat""

My question was about Vista. My ThinkPad came with XP Home and I have
both Admin and user accounts on it. User accounts in XP Home do not
have admin rights. However, most people never get past that first
account, which does have admin rights.

No. Just before my mobilization began in April 2006, I
had purchased 10.0 in the store.

Then in August 2006, after we finished our pre-deployment
training, we had a 4-day pass to go home and visit for a
bit before getting deployed... which is when I found
10.1 on the shelf (put together by some outfit like
Walnut Creek or something). I installed 10.1 in tent
in Kuwait (thank God we had electricity and air
conditioning!)",[],0,0

Depending on your hardware, there is at least one more. If you have an 
HP OfficeJet, that has fax capability, there is HPLIP, which provides 
for scanning, printing, and faxing. It sets up a printing queue for the 
fax, so as you mention further down you print from the app to the ""fax 
printer"", and then use HPLIP's GUI hp-toolbox to send the document. It 
works pretty well. I use it with an OfficeJet 5610. HTH

For lilo there is an option for loading modules from the boot prompt -
I'm sure grub has something similar.

That answers the question. Thanks.

Yes. I have found a reference to a webpage describing how to send faxes 
through CUPS (www.jennings.homelinux/fax_cups.html), which sounds 
interesting. Unfortunately, the site no longer exists, although the URL 
still brings up the server.

To: TuxOnIce-users Message-ID: <47AD8023.5010905@nigel.suspend2.net> Content-Type: text/plain; charset=""iso-8859-1"" Hi all. Here are test patches which should be of interest to this who've been having problems with the I/O speed. I'm providing patches for 2.6.23.15 and 2.6.24.1. The whole lowlevel I/O code has had quite a rework. In /sys/power/tuxonice/block_io, the only remaining entry is target_outstanding_io, which can be used to say how much memory you'd like to have made available for I/O. If more is available, it will be used too. There's one new entry in the /sys/power/tuxonice directory - no_flusher_thread. This entry is only useful if you've got multiple cpus/cores, and then only if no_multithreaded_io is 0 (ie multithreaded I/O is enabled). What I've done is this: by default, we now dedicate one thread (the CPU 0 one) to just submitting I/O. All other threads spend their time compressing pages and filling pages with the compressed data and associated metadata, then queueing filled pages for the submission thread to handle. If there's only one thread or no_flusher_thread is used, we go back to the old behaviour - threads compress, fill pages and submit them. So... options for multicore users: 1) Single threaded operation procsetting no_multithreaded_io 1 2) Multithreaded, flusher thread (default) procsetting no_multithreaded_io 0 procsetting no_flusher_thread 0 3) Multithreaded, no flusher thread procsetting no_multithreaded_io 0 procsetting no_flusher_thread 1 If you give the patches a try, would you please let me know how these different options perform?

This seems *way* too high. If there have been only 20 messages total in
that folder, sa-learn should have processed these in a few *seconds* or
less.

What did you expect? Based on your numbers above, processing that folder
would have taken 10-20 *hours*...

Hmm. Kmail doesn't start one process per mail by any chance?

Dunno if there are limitations -- however, your 7k messages should be
perfectly fine. Just ran a test on a 6k messages mbox file, and there
was no noticeable difference to a 30 messages test.

Thanks for this diagnosis.. in this case, the fix is actually simple:

Instead of doing the lookup straight in the module tree, we search 
for a pattern
with qr/$mod/i and it will find it that way -- this means it needs to 
spend a few
more CPU cycles getting the right answer, but the patch becomes easy:

--- lib/CPANPLUS/Internals/Search.pm (revision 2250)
+++ lib/CPANPLUS/Internals/Search.pm (local)
@@ -295,7 +295,18 @@
$mod = join '::', File::Spec->splitdir($mod);

+ ON_VMS
+ ? $self->search(
+ type => 'module',

+ : $self->module_tree($mod)
+ };
+
+ ### seperate return, a list context return with 
one ''
+ ### in it, is also true!
+ return unless $modobj;

push @rv, $modobj;
},

I've applied this patch to the development version of CPANPLUS.

Gene Heskett <vvqn.qwwsabl@verizon.net>,zqoqi@spamassassin.apache.org,2008-08-05 18:36:31,sa-learn --ham ground rules,"Greetings;

About an hour ago, based on some comments made that the bayes database needed 
trained on ham as well as spam, and because it seemed to be forgetting some 
of the stuff I'd fed it as spam, I re-wrote that filter rule in kmail to 
launch it using one of my sorted directories from a mailing this as the 
argument. Syntax otherwise the same as the sa-learn-spam filter.

The sa-learn --spam can process a message in 5 to 10 seconds or so, so if I've 
dropped 20 doofus mails in the spam directory and fire it off, I have it done 
and kmail is back among the living in 2-3 minutes.

But, feeding it a 'ham' directory with about 7k messages in it, turned 
sa-learn into a 100% cpu hog, incrementing the message processed number only 
about every 3 to 5 minutes. I couldn't kill it, it kept coming back and I 
must have fed it a kill -9 50 times. Finally, one of the kills killed x too! 
But no console came back, so I had to hit the reset button. The reboot was 
like molassses in January, so I did a power down, same story. Same story 3 
times running, so I went and made a sandwich while it set powered down. Then 
the reboot was normal up to e2fscking a a 372GB drive I use for amanda, the 
backup proggy. That hung, with no indication of progress for about 20 
minutes, no marching **** or anything. But it finally fell through and 
completed the bootup, and is running normally now but it has taken the 
majority of an hour to do this.

So what is the maximum number of files in a directory that one can feed to 
sa-learn --ham and expect it to achieve normal speed? I vaguely recall 
feeding it my corpus of another folder it was having trouble with a year ago, 
the linux-usb list, 600 to 1k messages in it and it was finished in an hour 
that time.

The command that kmail issues to it is:
sa-learn --ham /root/Mail/(foldername)/cur

Where foldername is whatever mailing list I want to tell it is ham.

Is this correct? I've had it setup that way for 2 or 3 years at least and 
till now it hasn't been that much of a problem.

It very much depends on the power supply in question.
Today i would recommend buying one with over 80% efficiency.
These often reach up to 85% efficiency,
but only when they operate around 50% load:
Power Supplies 101: A comprehensive guide Motherboards.org:
http://www.motherboards.org/articles/guides/1487_7.html

The study you quote may be a bit outdated (2002)
or be valid for cheap PSUs (Compaq).
It is certainly good to check the characteristics
of the PSU before you buy one:
http://www.80plus.org/manu/psu/manu_psu.htm

But as seen earlier in this thread,
calculating the power consumption needs
of the components used is not always easy.

Kind regards Philippe

information technology, or otherwise computationally related fields. It has 
been particularly pointed out, that also IS and other related fields are very 
welcome.

Last year the conference featured a ""Geeks and Suits"" event for career 
planning contacts with the (related) industry. Additionally excellent New 
Zealanders as key note speakers who have become internationally famous (Ian 
Foster as the ""godfather"" of Grid Computing, Craig Neville-Manning from 
Google, ...).

It was definitely worth it, and I expect it to be good again.

Fine.

Xorg.0.log:

(**) Option ""AIGLX"" ""on""


Good, indirect rendering is enabled, the rest is fine.

xorg.conf:

Fine.

All in all your config looks fine. There doesn't appear to be anything 
that would prevent compiz from loading.

3 Things:

(1) Copy the following into a script and run it from the command line to 
try and start compiz:

#!/bin/bash
emerald --replace &
sleep 1
LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 compiz \\
--ignore-desktop-hints \\
--replace \\
--indirect-rendering \\
--no-libgl-fallback \\
--sm-disable \\
ccp &

or just enter the following from a command line. Both commands are 
""single"" line commands but they get wrapped below. If it works, you can 
modify your fusion-icon scripts to include the needed command line options.

emerald --replace &

LIBGL_ALWAYS_INDIRECT=1 compiz --ignore-desktop-hints --replace 
--indirect-rendering --no-libgl-fallback --sm-disable ccp &

[you can ignore the hundreds of messages that get dumped back to the 
terminal if compiz starts. If it doesn't start and if there are only a 
handful of error, they may be useful]

(2) if it doesn't, can you run fgl_glxgears from a terminal?

(3) if still having problems, make sure your compiz files are updated by 
using yast->software management->actions->all packages->update if newer 
package is available

You will probably have to choose ""ignore conflicts here"" for the compiz 
conflicts in the X11/XGL repository.

Then run ""rpm -qa | grep compiz"" from a console and post the output.

Good luck!

Exchange Server 2007 mailbox role memory characterization using HP BladeSystem











 VIEW WEBCAST 














WHEN:
AVAILABLE ON DEMAND


SPEAKER:
Stuart Ladd, System Engineer, HP Microsoft Solution Alliances



SPONSOR: 
Hewlett-Packard Company


SUMMARY:
With Exchange 2007, Microsoft was able to move away from the limitations of a 32-bit operating system with the move to a 64-bit operating system using Windows Server 2003 x 64 platforms. This allowed for significant increases in available memory resources for the application, allowing memory to scale well beyond the 4GB available to Exchange 2003; designers could now cache greater portions of the Exchange database(s) in memory.
By increasing database cache, larger portions of the user's mailbox can now be cached, reducing the I/O demands on disk.

This webcast reviews the benefits of the additional system memory in the ProLiant BL480c blade server for Exchange 2007 and details other performance considerations when working with larger memory configurations.

I have tried setting the Mail Domain parameter to our family's domain
name (my husband and I are the only ones accessing mail through our
own SM 1.4.13 installation),
and when I try to login without using our Domain extension, I get an
""Unknown User or Password Incorrect"" error. However, if I include our
Domain extension, I can login
without a problem.

Here are the specifics of my ISP/installation:


- SM 1.4.13, manual installation
- Installed Plugins: address_add-2.1-1.4.0, calendar_file_backend-
1.0-2.0, shared_calendars-2.0.1-1.4.0, twc_weather-1.3p3b-RC2
- PHP v4.4.4
- Web Server: Apache 1.3.37 (Unix)
- IMAP Server: IMAP c-Client Version 2004 [not sure if this is what
you need, but it is all I could find...]
- SMTP Server: Cannot locate
- OS: Linux 2.6.9-55.0.2.ELsmp
- Browsers tried: Firefox (v2.0.0.12), IE7 (v7.0.5730.11), IE6 (
v6.0.2900.2180.xpsp2_gdr.070227-2254)

I tried a search online at SourceForge going back a couple months (before
the announcement of SM1.4.13) but didn't find anything. Any suggestions?

Thanks in advance.

computers but the fuckers who work with them, every person who uses them

here is my machine specs:

I've installed the chipset software from Nvidia for my motherboard hoping
that this would fix the issue.
I've installed realtek drivers to specifically try fix the networking issue.
Once they install I see no change on my device management setup. no new
network cards listed, just the standard ieee1394 controller.

My Other Pci Bridge Device and SM Bus Controller are still being listed as
other devices..

I'm going round in circles here and am at odds with reinstalling vista just
because I can't find the right driver.

Vista is pretty, but clunky and a resource eating beast. I've already forked
out on extra RAM and at 2gb I've hit capacity for my machine. (Thats not
including the capacity I've added through ready boost)

I want XP (I never thought I'd hear myself say that)!

plus this stupid fucking italian keyboard is making everything all the more
infuriating...whats the point in me meditating when technology is lurking
round every corne to thwart my good will.


cheers,

Richard

http://ask.metafilter.com/72827/Stolen-car-returned-within-minutes-Why

Can you help solve a somewhat bizarre and mysterious crime?

Here's the background story: My friend owns a late-model mini-van,
in very good condition. She had the van parked on the basement 3rd
level (B3) of a parking garage under the Tokyo Dome Hotel, which is
adjacent to the Tokyo Dome, a sports arena in downtown Tokyo (seats
55,000 people), as well as an amusement park and a small shopping
mall. Here's a link to a map showing the position of the hotel,
the Dome and surroundings.

The hotel was fully booked for a Japanese holiday period, and only
registered guests at the hotel would be able to gain access to the
hotel parking garage. My friend, who lives in Tokyo, was able to
park there that day, however, as she has a relative working at the
hotel who gave her a pass. She and her family came to the hotel for
dinner, arriving around 4PM. She returned to the garage at around 9PM
the same evening. She went to retrieve her car, but couldn't find
it on the B3 level where she'd parked. Wondering if she'd confused
her parking place, she went one level up, to B2. There she found
her van. Aside from the fact that it was on the wrong floor, she
noticed that it had been parked front-end in, whereas she had backed
her van into her parking place on the B3 level. The car was locked:
nothing seemed remiss, there were no traces that it had been broken
into, and nothing in the car (baby seat, miscellaneous kid's toys,
etc.) was missing.

My friend went first to hotel personnel, who called the police. Police
arrived at the hotel and inspected the car. They dusted for
fingerprints, they took her fingerprint samples to compare. They
questioned her about all details, speaking with her from around 10PM
til around 1AM. They told her they had dusted for fingerprints on
the steering wheel and gear shift, and had found nothing.

The surveillance tapes (which police showed to my friend) show a man
driving out of the garage in her mini-van at 6:30PM . Tapes also show
a man who is dressed identically but who appears to be a different
person (this also according to police who viewed the tapes) returning
only 12 minutes later, at 6:42PM. The tapes show the man driving
with the palms of his hands and/or his forearms, so as not to leave
prints. And although the weather was very hot that day the man (men)
were wearing an unbuttoned dress shirt over a t-shirt, plus a baseball
cap. Police told my friend that the shirt tail would've been used to
work the gearshift, so as not to leave prints. This man had the kind
of pass that a hotel guest would have, in order to leave the garage
in a vehicle, and return in a vehicle. This pass is also necessary
to gain entrance into the hotel building from the garage. This man
was also seen in surveillance tapes shot inside the hotel.

The street layout of the hotel/Dome complex requires a driver to
take a rather roundabout route, circling the Dome, in order to get
out of the complex and onto any other city streets. This route takes
approximately 10 minutes. The car was gone from out of the garage
for only 12 minutes, so it's safe to say it didn't go very far!

One last thing: the Tokyo cops who talked to my friend told her
that these guys seemed very professionsl and then they told her that
they'd probably never be caught!

Why would someone steal a car out of a garage, keep it for such a
short time, then have it returned so quickly (by another person in
identical clothing)?

It sounds a bit like you enabled syntax highlighting in gedit and the

(I just figured out why guards pronounce ""vehicle"" like ""veh hicle""
instead of ""vee hicle"", btw, it's because they have to fill out bilingual
forms all the time and the literal gaeilge translation is ""feithicil"".)

Worth noting this is leafy Grangegorman we're talking about here.
Glasnevin doesn't have this kind of behaviour, we just find Time Capsules.

Helga is already working on a shrine. Top StoryGetty ImagesTo the Moon and BackThe StoryNASAâs Artemis I mission is set to take off.Let the countdown begin. For the first time in nearly 50 years, NASA is launching a mission to the moon â using its most powerful rocket ever. There wonât be any astronauts on board. But todayâs launch is a crucial test that marks the start of NASAâs eagerly awaited new lunar program. Now â specifically, at 8:33 am ET â itâs time for blast off. (Hereâs how to watch.)Mission details, Houston. The missionâs spacecraft will travel more than 1.3 million miles around the moon over the course of 42 days. But ultimately this is all about preparing to bring humans back to the moon as soon as 2025...for the first time since 1972. NASA hopes to reach the moonâs unexplored south pole, where there might be ice in craters to support future crews. And it hopes to lay the groundwork for future missions to Mars by using the moonâs surface for training and testing.theSkimmNASAâs return to the moon has been decades in the making and cost billions to fund. Now itâs time to see whether the long-awaited program will give us the moon, or if expectations will have to come back to Earth. And Also...ThisWhatâs got us trying to read in between the linesâ¦The Mar-a-Lago affidavit. On Friday, the Department of Justice released a heavily redacted 32-page affidavit. Itâs the document the FBI used to get a warrant to search former President Donald Trumpâs home in August. The affidavit confirms that secret documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year. Reminder: back in January, Trumpâs team returned 15 boxes of government documents to the National Archives after taking them home from the White House. The affidavit says those included 184 documents labeled as âsecret,â âconfidential,â or âtop secret.â And contained info about âclandestine human sourcesâ (think: spies or informants) that could have been dangerous in the wrong hands. Fast forward to August: the FBI went back to Trumpâs residence with their warrant, and found 11 additional sets of classified documents. The DOJ hasnât commented beyond the release of the affidavit, but in June it said the documents hadnât been âhandled in an appropriate manner.â Trumpâs spokesperson says that there was no reason for a search and that itâs âall politics.â Whoâs saying âI did it firstââ¦Moderna. Last week, the Massachusetts-based company sued Pfizer and the German drugmaker BioNTech for patent infringement. Moderna says that Pfizer and BioNTech hit copy and paste on its mRNA tech for their COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna claims it filed the patents way back between 2010 and 2016. The company pledged not to enforce its patent when the pandemic was in full force. And it says it isnât trying to get Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines off the market now. But it wants companies to respect its intellectual property and request proper permission to use its work. Both Pfizer and BioNTech responded that their work is original, and say theyâll defend themselves in court.â¦Oh and speaking of vaccines, the Biden admin is expected to have Omicron-specific boosters ready around the week after Labor Day.Whatâs got parents talkingâ¦Missouri. This summer, Cassville R-IV School District in western MO gave the âOKâ to bring back spanking. The district told parents that it would start swatting students with paddles as a punishment for misbehavior. Kids would only be spanked if their parents give written permission â with a choice to opt out later. The district also claims it will only swat kids as a last resort and that it will not be done in front of their peers. Other rules: two workers must be present (the spanker and a witness) and they cannot hit students in the head or face. The measure is a school board response to a survey sent to parents, students, and staff, which found that parents were worried about student behavior. Many states have outlawed corporal punishment in schools â but Missouri is one of 19 that still allow it.Whoâs GOAT us in our feelsâ¦Serena Williams.

Well, the destruction technically happens *after* the undef
instruction has finished. So the current COP points at the next
statement. Which might be far away... or might even not have a line
number associated to it. That happens if the undef() call is done at
the end of an END block.

I understand that might be not practical, but that's the first time I

I have XP Pro at home. How do I access the Administrator account, so that
I can unzip some files that have been sent to me? AFAIR, the install did not
ask me for a password, so I don't have one--that I know of. What an idiot

I just assumed that unix vs inet problems were chroot related however i'm 
willing to try the inet path (I was limited due to vserver firewall rules

Linux being based on Unix incorporates the Unix security model.
The Unix security model EXPECTS hostile code to be run on the
system. The design is for a multi-user system, and even assuming
that all users are both legitimate AND use the system in good
faith, it assumes that not all programmers are perfect, and
that accidents DO in fact happen.

That's what all of the read/write/execute permissions are
about.

And THAT is what keeps me and my system safe.

The primary threat is the buffer-overflow problem, which was
demonstrated so devastatingly in 1987 by the Morris Worm. We
learned our lessen then about the use of strcat() instead of
strncat(), and other similarly unlimited writes into stack
space (or other memory for that matter).

All of which STILL execute within the chains of R/W/X permissions.
That's WHAT THEY ARE THERE FOR.

You truly don't know what you're talking about.

Go buy AND READ ""The Design of the Unix Operating System""
by Maurice J. Bach.

I paid $80 or so for the 3rd edition in the 1980's.
Used copies of the 4th edition are now available for
the paltry sum of $15 or so.

Ken Schneider <gyac-crka9@bout-tyme.net>,openSUSE <wkilxloc@opensuse.org>,2008-08-05 19:26:36,[opensuse] 11.0 A2,"First impressions.

Fresh install on real machine went smoothly on one machine but trying to
upgrade an 11.0A1 VirtualBox install failed to upgrade even one package.
No errors occurred it just seemed to skip the part where software would
be selected.

Since KDE 4 is the default KDE version installed and it is still fairly
new there are numerous bugs that I hope are worked out before the GM
release. But then that is why I am testing on spare hardware, to help
find the bugs. It also appears that the KDE devs are taking lessons from
the gnome devs where less control is better. The number of options
available for config in the control panel is far less then what I would
expect based on past experience. This could be setup as a choice:
beginner == fewer options presented, advanced == more config options
presented.

On freshly installed machine my Logitech wheel mouse is not recognized.
Even after adding the appropriate info in xorg.conf.

Re-sizing any window larger in the KDE desktop requires a click in the
missing portion to make it visible.

Launching KDE apps from the menu (or via alt-f2 popup) causes a SIGSEGV
error to pop up but they run from the command line.

More info (and bug reports opened) as I continue to test.

Bottom line: keep up the great work as I think this will end up as a
very good version, not great (because of the KDE4 bugs that will
persist. But that is to be expected when you have a major UI change.

Jakub Nadolny <enepi.vylgnov@carrywater.pl>,rljdsng-xyqoh@postfix.org,2008-08-06 0:53:50,Mail attachements truncated,"Hi,

I've got following problem. Sometimes mail attachments are truncated
and and e-mail is send but files are corrupted. 

Mail header contains then:
""X-Amavis-Alert: BAD HEADER MIME error: error: part did not end with
expected boundary"". And that is true - there is no boundary for MIME and
data stream is not completed.

I've turned on detailed postfix debugging and it looks like at some
point there is: 
smtp_get: EOF
instead of:
< some_IP: QUIT
> some_IP: 221 2.0.0 Bye

Attachment is truncated after different sizes (sometimes 65kB, sometimes
200kB) and after different times (25s, 100s).

The only common thing I've found is that all such mails come from one internet
provider that is public-gprs*.centertel.pl

I guess it might be the problem with this provider (Orange Poland) but
on the other hand they can send e-mails through other mail servers
without such a problem.

I got stuck with it. Is there any way to debug it more? Do you have any
ideas what could be the cause?

I use postfix 2.3.8 on Debian Stable + amavis etc.

Thanks in advance!

master.cf; 10026 is the last of three smtpd listeners:

:10026 inet n - n - 50 smtpd
-o content_filter=
-o smtpd_client_restrictions=
-o smtpd_helo_restrictions=
-o smtpd_sender_restrictions=
-o smtpd_error_sleep_time=0
-o smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,reject
-o receive_override_options=no_unknown_recipient_checks
-o smtpd_milters=inet:localhost:10004
-o disable_mime_output_conversion=yes
-o milter_macro_daemon_name=ORIGINATING
-o milter_default_action=accept

Default milter_protocol is 3 (6 as advised for PF 2.5 *does* give 
SMFIC_HEADER faults).

milter_macro_daemon_name corresponds to 'MTA ORIGINATING' in 
/etc/dkim-filter.conf - even though people have written that that's not 
necessary any more with current versions of dkim-milter.

Best,

File::Spec->catdir will put the path back together.

The '/' trick only works if the string is a directory name with UNIX 
style directory delimiters or no directory delimiters. It is to force 
vmsify to treat the input specification as UNIX.

There is a VMS::Filespec::unixpath() to do the appending of the '/' to 
the specification, which will do a VMS::Filespec::vmsify() if needed.

However it is not a good idea to call vmsify() on a pathname returned by 
unixify(), and it is not a good idea to call unixify() on a pathname 
returned by vmsify(). Because of the nature of the conversion, not all 
file specifications can make the round trip.

I think that directory specifications can safely make the round trip, 
but not ones containing filenames.

Millions With Chronic Disease Get Little to No Treatment 
By _REED ABELSON_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/reed_abelson/index.html?inline=nyt-per) 

Millions of Americans with chronic disease like _diabetes_ 
(http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/diabetes/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier) 
or _high blood pressure_ 
(http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/hypertension/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier) are not getting adequate 
treatment because they are among the nationâs growing ranks of uninsured. 
That is the central finding of a new study to be published Tuesday in the 
medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine. 
The study, the first detailed look at the health of the uninsured, estimates 
that about one of every three working-age adults without insurance in the 
United States has received a diagnosis of a chronic illness. Many of these people 
are forgoing doctorsâ visits or relying on emergency rooms for their medical 
care, the study said. 
The report, based on an analysis of government health surveys of adults ages 
18 to 64 years old, estimated that about 11 million of the 36 million people 
without insurance in 2004 â the latest year of the study â had received a 
chronic-condition diagnosis. 
âThese are people who, with modern therapies, can be kept out of trouble,â 
said Dr. Andrew P. Wilper, the studyâs lead author. Therapies for someone with 
diabetes and hypertension âare routine and widely available, if you have 
insurance,â said Dr. Wilper, a medical instructor at the _University of Washington_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/universit
y_of_washington/index.html?inline=nyt-org) in Seattle. 
The most recent government estimate of the number of people in this country 
without _health insurance_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=ny
t-classifier) is 47 million, which means that if the proportions found in 
the study have remained constant, there might be nearly 16 million people in 
this country with a chronic condition but no insurance to pay for medical care. 
Nearly a quarter of the uninsured with a chronic illness who were surveyed 
said they had not visited a health professional within the last year. About 7 
percent said they typically went to a hospital emergency room for care. 
âA lot of people are suffering from a lack of health insurance,â said Dr. 
Steffie Woolhandler, another of the studyâs authors, who is a physician and 
associate professor of medicine at Harvard. 
People with high blood pressure, for example, are at risk for catastrophic 
medical events like a stroke if they are not getting the drugs they need or 
having a doctor monitor their disease, said Karen Davis, the president of the 
Commonwealth Fund. The fund, a foundation in New York that specializes in health 
care research, has done its own research into the lack of adequate medical care 
among the uninsured. 
The study, being published Tuesday, may have underestimated exactly how many 
people who are uninsured have a chronic illness, because it includes only 
those who have already received such a diagnosis, the authors said. Individuals 
who have not had their conditions diagnosed because they are not seeing a doctor 
or nurse are not included. 
The studyâs authors say that their findings cast doubt on the common 
assumption that many of the uninsured tend to be young and healthy, requiring little 
in the way of medical care. Because so many actually have chronic conditions 
that may be expensive to treat, the cost of covering the uninsured is often 
underestimated, said Dr. Woolhandler, who advocates a nationalized system of 
health care. 
In Massachusetts, she said, the stateâs effort to overhaul its health 
insurance system to cover more residents is costing much more than expected and has 
not led to universal coverage because policy makers assumed that more people 
would be healthy. âThe state experiments have all failed because of cost,â she 
said. 
The study describes harsh consequences for neglecting easily treatable 
diseases in so many people. âFor some of the 11.4 million uninsured Americans with 
serious chronic conditions, access to care seems to be unobtainable; many may 
face early disability and death as a result,â the studyâs authors said.

No, as I've found in:
# postconf | grep smtpd_proxy
smtpd_proxy_ehlo = $myhostname
smtpd_proxy_filter = 
smtpd_proxy_timeout = 100s

Anyway
Builds fine on HP-UX 10.20 PA-RISC
All tests successful.
u=0.62 s=0.28 cu=18.01 cs=1.67 scripts=185 tests=14327



Build fails on HP-UX 11.23 Itanium2 -Duse64bitall:

make: *** [lib/auto/ODBM_File/ODBM_File.sl] Error 2

This is because the -Duse64bitall did not correctly propagate to the ccflags,
so you end up with

% file perl
perl: ELF-32 executable object file - IA64

It would require to change the ccflags from -Aa to -Ae +DD64, but then I
also need to change the lib search path etc etc
Just because I could not resist the first two steps ...

I recently formatted my hp pavillion(s7720.uk) in order to reinstall xp on
it. (Vista was driving me round the bend).
I'm not sure my machine was intended to run anything other than vista. Now
that I've installed xp on it I am missing certain drivers. \\most importantly
\\i cannot connect it to the internet which means I cannot easily search for
drivers.

at present I'm missing drivers for -

SM Bus Controller
Video Controller

What I'm hoping for is that one of you is a hp expert and could help me sort
this out. I'm used to Dell machines so this is proving to be a royal pain in
the $%^ at the moment. To top it off the only other machine in the house is
my italian flatmates spyware ridden piece of shit, wich means saving my own
machine is further complicated.

In fact I do, but I have myself somewhat in a sandbox as all the mail handling 
stuff except kmail runs as an unprivileged user, and kmail pulls incoming 
from that mailbox in /var. I've been doing that for about 2-3 of years, 
started it back at FC2. And running as root since RH5.1. Yeah, I'm an 
un-repentant old fart.

i have a couple of questions regarding sasl.

In main.cf i have:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
smtpd_sasl_local_domain=
smtpd_sasl_path=smtpd

broken_sasl_auth_clients=yes

smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject_unauth_destination

verify_login=reject_sender_login_mismatch

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in my_domains:

mydomain1 verify_login
mydomain2 verify_login
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using this configuration user1@mydomain1 cannot pretend he is a 
different user. For example, he cannot send an email saying he is 
user2@mydomain2.

Question1: How can i exclude a user from this rule based on his IP? in 
main.cf i've added: mynetworks=127.0.0.1, his_ip_address but it does not 
work.

Question2: The rule above works fine for all users when they use a 
webmail client or any other client. The only problem is with users who 
use squirrelmail. They still can send emails with a fake ""from address""! 
Postfix cannot stop them.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Millions With Chronic Disease Get Little to No Treatment 
By _REED ABELSON_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/reed_abelson/index.html?inline=nyt-per) 

Millions of Americans with chronic disease like _diabetes_ 
(http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/diabetes/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier) 
or _high blood pressure_ 
(http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/hypertension/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier) are not getting adequate 
treatment because they are among the nationâs growing ranks of uninsured. 
That is the central finding of a new study to be published Tuesday in the 
medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine. 
The study, the first detailed look at the health of the uninsured, estimates 
that about one of every three working-age adults without insurance in the 
United States has received a diagnosis of a chronic illness. Many of these people 
are forgoing doctorsâ visits or relying on emergency rooms for their medical 
care, the study said. 
The report, based on an analysis of government health surveys of adults ages 
18 to 64 years old, estimated that about 11 million of the 36 million people 
without insurance in 2004 â the latest year of the study â had received a 
chronic-condition diagnosis. 
âThese are people who, with modern therapies, can be kept out of trouble,â 
said Dr. Andrew P. Wilper, the studyâs lead author. Therapies for someone with 
diabetes and hypertension âare routine and widely available, if you have 
insurance,â said Dr. Wilper, a medical instructor at the _University of Washington_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/universit
y_of_washington/index.html?inline=nyt-org) in Seattle. 
The most recent government estimate of the number of people in this country 
without _health insurance_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=ny
t-classifier) is 47 million, which means that if the proportions found in 
the study have remained constant, there might be nearly 16 million people in 
this country with a chronic condition but no insurance to pay for medical care. 
Nearly a quarter of the uninsured with a chronic illness who were surveyed 
said they had not visited a health professional within the last year. About 7 
percent said they typically went to a hospital emergency room for care. 
âA lot of people are suffering from a lack of health insurance,â said Dr. 
Steffie Woolhandler, another of the studyâs authors, who is a physician and 
associate professor of medicine at Harvard. 
People with high blood pressure, for example, are at risk for catastrophic 
medical events like a stroke if they are not getting the drugs they need or 
having a doctor monitor their disease, said Karen Davis, the president of the 
Commonwealth Fund. The fund, a foundation in New York that specializes in health 
care research, has done its own research into the lack of adequate medical care 
among the uninsured. 
The study, being published Tuesday, may have underestimated exactly how many 
people who are uninsured have a chronic illness, because it includes only 
those who have already received such a diagnosis, the authors said. Individuals 
who have not had their conditions diagnosed because they are not seeing a doctor 
or nurse are not included. 
The studyâs authors say that their findings cast doubt on the common 
assumption that many of the uninsured tend to be young and healthy, requiring little 
in the way of medical care. Because so many actually have chronic conditions 
that may be expensive to treat, the cost of covering the uninsured is often 
underestimated, said Dr. Woolhandler, who advocates a nationalized system of 
health care. 
In Massachusetts, she said, the stateâs effort to overhaul its health 
insurance system to cover more residents is costing much more than expected and has 
not led to universal coverage because policy makers assumed that more people 
would be healthy. âThe state experiments have all failed because of cost,â she 
said. 
The study describes harsh consequences for neglecting easily treatable 
diseases in so many people. âFor some of the 11.4 million uninsured Americans with 
serious chronic conditions, access to care seems to be unobtainable; many may 
face early disability and death as a result,â the studyâs authors said.

FROM THE EDITOR


Podcast update: Threats and trends for 2008
[Maggie Wright, Assistant Editor]
rybamlk@techtarget.com

Per usual, we have several new and interesting audio downloads for you this month, highlighting topics such as malware, network access control and the threat landscape for 2008. 

Malware has been a hot topic in '08. Nugache, sophisticated rootkits and ransomware have all made headlines. Now, after quietly falling off the radar, PDF spam could be making a comeback. Last week, MX Logic, an antispam and managed services vendor, reported that it is tracking PDF spam found in unwanted messages. As part of our Seacurity Wire Weekly podcast series, Sam Masiello, director of threat
management at MX Logic, offered his opinions on why the format has resurfaced, how security researchers found it and whether an increase in PDF spam is likely. Also, security researchers at Facetime Communications warn of a new do-it-yourself phishing program that assists phishers in attacking social networking sites like MySpace and Facebook.

The network access control (NAC) market was the topic of choice in our Jan. 23rd Security Wire Weekly edition. Dave Bixler, CISO for Siemens IT Solutions and Services, talks about the state of the network access control market, where NAC technology is headed and why he thinks it's smart for organizations to hold off on NAC deployments. 

In our first Security Squad podcast of the New Year, the SearchSecurity.com editors discussed the likelihood of a massive cyberattack in 2008. The team also examines the Sears spyware scandal. 

In last month's Threat Monitor podcast, security threats expert Ed Skoudis unveiled what he thinks will be the biggest security threats in 2008, and offers advice on how corporations can defend against them. Some of the threats mentioned include spear-phishing, botnets and malware email attacks. 

Be sure to check out our brand-new Compliance School podcast, Fact or fiction: Involving end users in the compliance program. Richard E. Mackey, vice president of consultancy SystemExperts, discloses the tools needed to educate end users about the importance of compliance, how users can get involved in the compliance program and why compliance is an essential aspect of corporate risk management.

We're adding new recordings all the time, so remember, you can visit our audio downloads page at any time to listen to all of our security podcasts and subscribe to our podcast feeds.

Have a great weekend!

I pounded my head against this issue when working on a .bat file a few
years back, until I read the help for cmd and saw the quote logic (and
switched to VBScript). It's still there, in ""help cmd"". I had once found
references to the same issue for the run command in Microsoft's online help.

Perhaps it is fixed in SP2. If so, just change it and don't worry about
users with earlier versions of Windows.

Helga is already working on a shrine. Top StoryGetty ImagesTo the Moon and BackThe StoryNASAâs Artemis I mission is set to take off.Let the countdown begin. For the first time in nearly 50 years, NASA is launching a mission to the moon â using its most powerful rocket ever. There wonât be any astronauts on board. But todayâs launch is a crucial test that marks the start of NASAâs eagerly awaited new lunar program. Now â specifically, at 8:33 am ET â itâs time for blast off. (Hereâs how to watch.)Mission details, Houston. The missionâs spacecraft will travel more than 1.3 million miles around the moon over the course of 42 days. But ultimately this is all about preparing to bring humans back to the moon as soon as 2025...for the first time since 1972. NASA hopes to reach the moonâs unexplored south pole, where there might be ice in craters to support future crews. And it hopes to lay the groundwork for future missions to Mars by using the moonâs surface for training and testing.theSkimmNASAâs return to the moon has been decades in the making and cost billions to fund. Now itâs time to see whether the long-awaited program will give us the moon, or if expectations will have to come back to Earth. And Also...ThisWhatâs got us trying to read in between the linesâ¦The Mar-a-Lago affidavit. On Friday, the Department of Justice released a heavily redacted 32-page affidavit. Itâs the document the FBI used to get a warrant to search former President Donald Trumpâs home in August. The affidavit confirms that secret documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year. Reminder: back in January, Trumpâs team returned 15 boxes of government documents to the National Archives after taking them home from the White House. The affidavit says those included 184 documents labeled as âsecret,â âconfidential,â or âtop secret.â And contained info about âclandestine human sourcesâ (think: spies or informants) that could have been dangerous in the wrong hands. Fast forward to August: the FBI went back to Trumpâs residence with their warrant, and found 11 additional sets of classified documents. The DOJ hasnât commented beyond the release of the affidavit, but in June it said the documents hadnât been âhandled in an appropriate manner.â Trumpâs spokesperson says that there was no reason for a search and that itâs âall politics.â Whoâs saying âI did it firstââ¦Moderna. Last week, the Massachusetts-based company sued Pfizer and the German drugmaker BioNTech for patent infringement. Moderna says that Pfizer and BioNTech hit copy and paste on its mRNA tech for their COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna claims it filed the patents way back between 2010 and 2016. The company pledged not to enforce its patent when the pandemic was in full force. And it says it isnât trying to get Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines off the market now. But it wants companies to respect its intellectual property and request proper permission to use its work. Both Pfizer and BioNTech responded that their work is original, and say theyâll defend themselves in court.â¦Oh and speaking of vaccines, the Biden admin is expected to have Omicron-specific boosters ready around the week after Labor Day.Whatâs got parents talkingâ¦Missouri. This summer, Cassville R-IV School District in western MO gave the âOKâ to bring back spanking. The district told parents that it would start swatting students with paddles as a punishment for misbehavior. Kids would only be spanked if their parents give written permission â with a choice to opt out later. The district also claims it will only swat kids as a last resort and that it will not be done in front of their peers. Other rules: two workers must be present (the spanker and a witness) and they cannot hit students in the head or face. The measure is a school board response to a survey sent to parents, students, and staff, which found that parents were worried about student behavior. Many states have outlawed corporal punishment in schools â but Missouri is one of 19 that still allow it.Whoâs GOAT us in our feelsâ¦Serena Williams.

Their server identifies itself as ns.ky3.com, but DNS resolves 
ns.ky3.com to 208.183.224.88 which in turn resolves to

ns.ky3.com has address 208.184.224.88
88.224.184.208.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer cmscache.clickability.com.

I have a weird problem with 10.1 and using home,end,backspace,delete etc in
console programs (vi for example). On bash prompt using home, end doesn't
work (nothing happens, while it should move cursor to start or end of the
line). Using vi home,end works, but when in insert mode, I can't use
backspace (nothing happens), delete works as long as there are characters on
the line, when there are no more characters available, it should delete the
line and move to next but that doesn't happen. This doesn't seem to be a
problem in 10.3 when I'm connected directly, but if I ssh from 10.1 to 10.3
server same thing happens. I'm guessing some terminal issue but I wasn't
able to pinpoint it.
