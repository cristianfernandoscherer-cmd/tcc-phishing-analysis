Dear Dr. Meyer



Bentham Science Publishers have gained a longstanding international
reputation for their excellent standards and top quality science
publications. Many journals published by Bentham Science Publishers have
received high impact factors in their respective fields. For the current
list of publications, please visit www.bentham.org. Seven Nobel Laureates
have endorsed a number of Bentham Science's journals; please read their
quotes at www.bentham.org/Nobel.htm 



The publishers are now undertaking a new publication venture by launching a
number of Open Access journals in 2007, devoted to various disciplines in
the fields of science and technology. 



Open Access Journals are freely accessible via the Internet for immediate
worldwide, open access to the full text of articles, serving the best
interests of the scientific community. All interested readers can read,
download and/or print open access articles at no cost. There is no
subscription fee for Open Access journals. The modest open access
publication costs are usually covered by the author's institution or
research funds. Moreover, authors who publish in our Open Access journals
retain the copyright of their article. Open Access journals are no different
from traditional subscription-based journals; they undergo the same
peer-review process and quality control as any other scholarly journal.



The Open Artificial Intelligence Journal is an Open Access online journal,
which publishes research articles, reviews and letters in all areas of
artificial intelligence. Please visit the journal's homepage and
Instructions for Authors for article submission at the following website
www.bentham.org/open/toaij 



The journal aims to provide the most complete and reliable source of
information on current developments in the field. The emphasis will be on
publishing quality articles rapidly and making them freely available to the
researchers worldwide. All published articles will be deposited immediately
upon publication in at least one widely and internationally recognized open
access repository. The published open access articles will be indexed by
Google and Google Scholar, thereby assuring their massive international
exposure. Moreover, similar to all open access publications, the articles
will also receive high citations.



The journal is essential reading for scientists and researchers who wish to
keep up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. The publishers
are confident of the journal's rapid success. 



In this connection, I would like to invite you to submit a research article,
review article or short communication/letter article to The Open Artificial
Intelligence Journal.



In case you are interested in submitting an article to this Open Access
journal, please refer to either the journal's Instructions for Authors (the
journal's website is stated above) or alternatively contact us by e-mail at
lbtvp@benthamscience.org or iggccz@benthamscience.org for submission
guidelines.



Thank you in advance for your consideration to submit an article to our Open
Access journal.



We look forward to hearing from you soon.



With kind regards, 



Yours sincerely,



Matthew Honan, PhD 

Editorial Director 

Bentham Science Publishers

i have a couple of questions regarding sasl.

in my_domains:

mydomain1 verify_login
mydomain2 verify_login
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using this configuration user1@mydomain1 cannot pretend he is a 
different user. For example, he cannot send an email saying he is 
user2@mydomain2.

Question1: How can i exclude a user from this rule based on his IP? in 
main.cf i've added: mynetworks=127.0.0.1, his_ip_address but it does not 
work.

Question2: The rule above works fine for all users when they use a 
webmail client or any other client. The only problem is with users who 
use squirrelmail. They still can send emails with a fake ""from address""! 
Postfix cannot stop them.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Locate a copy of jhylafax, and install this. You will have a GUI
front end for sending faxes. Note, the version that I have does not
auto update the send state of the fax, and with the modem speaker turned
off you will not really know if your phone line is free. BTW there is
KdeprintFax (kdeprintfax -caption ""%c"" %i %m %u -- on the command
line.)

Linux being based on Unix incorporates the Unix security model.
The Unix security model EXPECTS hostile code to be run on the
system. The design is for a multi-user system, and even assuming
that all users are both legitimate AND use the system in good
faith, it assumes that not all programmers are perfect, and
that accidents DO in fact happen.

That's what all of the read/write/execute permissions are
about.

And THAT is what keeps me and my system safe.

The primary threat is the buffer-overflow problem, which was
demonstrated so devastatingly in 1987 by the Morris Worm. We
learned our lessen then about the use of strcat() instead of
strncat(), and other similarly unlimited writes into stack
space (or other memory for that matter).

All of which STILL execute within the chains of R/W/X permissions.
That's WHAT THEY ARE THERE FOR.

You truly don't know what you're talking about.

Go buy AND READ ""The Design of the Unix Operating System""
by Maurice J. Bach.

I paid $80 or so for the 3rd edition in the 1980's.
Used copies of the 4th edition are now available for
the paltry sum of $15 or so.

You're forgetting there may be some additional power consumed by the
power supply itself. This might be a bit more for a larger supply. 
Even with no load, all power supplies draw some power.

Hylafax is a fax server (a very good one), and as such, it doesn't need a 
GUI - same as most or all services in Linux don't. However, there are many 
clients that can connect to hylafax and some of them are GUIs; there are 
java clients, for example, that work in windows. Just have a look at the 
hylafax website and choose one you like.

Because faxes are sent to the server as postscript, and because it usually 
sends them to the user as postscript, too (or tiff or pdf, if so 
configured). You don't see the raster.

For example, you can configure your system as a mail server that converts 
mails to faxes and sends them, and viceversa. Or you can print to a samba 
printer that faxes the pages. There are many possibilities.

In fact I do, but I have myself somewhat in a sandbox as all the mail handling 
stuff except kmail runs as an unprivileged user, and kmail pulls incoming 
from that mailbox in /var. I've been doing that for about 2-3 of years, 
started it back at FC2. And running as root since RH5.1. Yeah, I'm an 
un-repentant old fart.

Yes, I plan to solve this by pulling them for summaries, as well. I'm
not sure at the moment if its better to pull them into one summary or
three. I would think one, with all the cross over that happens these

All that shows is their external address. They use NAT. Anyway, it's

=============
Announcements

Summaries
=========

---------------
About SSL tests
---------------

An open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep
open. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a
'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the
terminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform
Subprocess Termination`).

Contributing thread:

- `About SSL tests
`__

-------------------------------------
Cross-Platform Subprocess Termination
-------------------------------------

Because os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows
platforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows
platforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.
Support was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-
platform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually
incorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was
given.

Contributing thread:

- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)

------------------------
Extended buffer protocol
------------------------

Updates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP
documenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the
plans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.

(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real
degree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants
to add to the summary, it will stay short.)

Contributing threads:

- `Extended buffer PEP
`__
- `PEP 3118: Extended buffer protocol (new version)
`__
- `Extended Buffer Protocol - simple use examples
`__

-----------------------------------------
function for counting items in a sequence
-----------------------------------------

A patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),
implemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping
between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were
suggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of
items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning
due to a just-makes-sense factor.

Contributing thread:

- `function for counting items in a sequence
`__

----------------------------------------
context manager - generator interaction?
----------------------------------------

A problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside
the with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context
manager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist
without the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of
a formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.

Contributing thread:

- `context manager - generator interaction?
`__

-----------------------------
proposed which.py replacement
-----------------------------

Suggestion of replacing the which.py script in the Tools directory migrated to
its proposal for inclusion into the standard library. A patch and tests have
yet to be provided.

Contributing thread:

- `proposed which.py replacement
`_

-----------------------
minidom and DOM level 2
-----------------------

What is missing for DOM Level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and
some work jumpstarted.

Contributing thread:

- `minidom and DOM level 2
`__

----------------------------------------------
test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
----------------------------------------------

Differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose
mode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes
before a waitpid() call.

Contributing thread:

- `test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
`__

-------------------------
HTTP Responses and Errors
-------------------------

In 2xx HTTP responses mean that the request was handled OK. The
existing library was special-casing the most common responses and
treating others as errors. After verifying that there wasn't a good
reason for the old behavior, Facundo Batista fixed it.

Contributing thread:

- `HTTP responses and errors
`__

------------------------
Build Problem on Windows
------------------------

It is a generated file; the actual problem is in make_buildinfo

Contributing thread:

- `build problem on windows: unable to find getbuildinfo2.c
`__

--------------------------
BaseException Pickle Issue
--------------------------

Exceptions are now new-style classes; this caused some obscure
problems with picking and unpickling.

http://www.python.org/sf/1498571

and later

http://www.python.org/sf/1692335

should resolve the issue.

Contributing thread:

- `BaseException pickle issue
`__

---------------------------------
Deprecating BaseException.message
---------------------------------

Plans changed; BaseException will still accept an args tuple, so don't
bother with the .message attribute. Probably the shorted leaved Python
feature ever. See PEP 352.

Contributing thread:

- `deprecating BaseException.message
`__

---------------------
Changes to decimal.py
---------------------

The external standard has been updated; python's implementation will
be updated to match.

Contributing threads:

- `Changes to decimal.py
`__
- `Fwd: Re: Changes to decimal.py
`__

----------------------------------------
Pydoc Rewrite Discussion at doc-sig list
----------------------------------------

An announcement that the (normally quiet) doc-sig mailing list would
be discussing a rewrite of pydoc.
http://mail.python.org/pipermail/doc-sig/

Contributing thread:

- `Pydoc Rewrite Discussion at doc-sig list.
`__

------------------------------
Making builtins more efficient
------------------------------

Andrea Griffini posted a patch at sourceforge that makes builtin
lookups almost as fast as locals.

https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&atid=305470&aid=1616125&group_id=5470

[1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-February/msg00001.html === Fedora 9 Alpha Jigdo === JeroenVanMeeuwen announces in fedora-announce-list[1], ""Fedora Unity announces the Fedora 9 Alpha release is now also available via Jigdo. Jigdo saves you a lot of bandwidth and time if you already have the data (maybe a local mirror or previously released media), and has been proposed as a feature for Fedora 9."" [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-February/msg00002.html === Fedora 8 20080204 Re-Spin === BenWilliams announces in fedora-announce-list[1], ""The Fedora Unity Project is proud to announce the release of new ISO Re-Spins (DVD and CD Sets) of Fedora 8. These Re-Spin ISOs are based on the officially released Fedora 8 installation media and include all updates released as of February 4,2008. The ISO images are available for i386 and x86_64 architectures via jigdo starting Thursday, February 7, 2008. We have included CD Image sets for those in the Fedora community that do not have DVD drives or burners available.""

I started the Store SIG a few months ago when I had some extra time, and as an attempt to bring some sanity to the problems of distributing swag globally, both for individuals and events."" [1] http://spevack.livejournal.com/44818.html === Happy 10th Birthday, Open Source! === JohnBabich points out in his blog[1], ""Bruce Perens published the Open Source Definition on 9 February, 1998. He commemorates the event in ''State of Open Source Message: A New Decade For Open Source''. This is a great article and should be read in its entirety by anyone who appreciates Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)."" [1] http://jmbuser.livejournal.com/9080.html === Field report from GNUnify 2008 === SankarshanMukhopadhyay points out in his blog[1], ""As promised earlier, here's a quick round-up of the event. I spent the entire two days on 8th and 9th (of February, 2008) at GNUnify 2008. I did not have any specific talks to attend and went more to find out for myself about all the good stuff that I have heard till date about this event. Sayamindu had come down (he had a talk on OLPC) and so on Day 1 of the event we started a bit late and gate crashed into Brian Behlendorf's talk related to 10 things about Open Source. A fairly straight forward talk introducing Open Source to the hall full of students it also had the old dogs indulging in some back seat fun."" [1] http://sankarshan.randomink.org/blog/2008/02/10/field-report-from-gnunify-2008/ === SCALE 6x: I'm Here - Saturday in Review === ClintSavage reports in his blog[1], ""Just left Jono Bacon's presentation on ''The future of the Linux Desktop''. He's quite an awesome presenter. Afterward, I went down to the exhibit floor and got to say hi to TomCallaway and actually met ThomasChung from the Fedora Project. Both of these guys have such exuberance and joy, I love being part of the fedora project."" [1] http://fedora-tutorials.com/2008/02/10/scale-6x-im-here-saturday-in-review/ === SCALE 6x: cally four nya === TomCallaway reports in his blog[1], ""Here I am, in Los Angeles, at SCALE 6x. I've never been to SCALE before, but I'm really impressed. Its this mix of extinct old school Linux conferences like ALS and LinuxExpo, trade shows like Comdex, and smart tech conferences like OSCON. Amazingly, they're pulling it off really well. There are just a lot of smart people and a lot of curious people, and a really vibrant feeling to it that can't help but get you excited about it. I'm not sure if the fact that it is in LA Is helping the effect, or merely making it more unique. In the last two days, I've met more people than I could possibly remember, and observed some of the ''behind-the-scene'' workings of the open source community that I've always been aware of, but never invited to participate in."" [1] http://spot.livejournal.com/288127.html === Fedora General-Purpose Posters Part 2 === MairinDuffy points out in her blog[1], ""Thanks to everybody who helped me out with the poster design here in my blog and in fedora-marketing-list. I think this cut is pretty good so if you are willing to translate the poster into another language or if you would simply like to have it printed up, it's ready now.""

State of the SIG === JeffreyTadlock reports in fedora-marketing-list[1], ""It is time for a Fedora Store SIG update! To bring people up to speed, the Fedora Store SIG was founded by Max Spevack as a means to solve two major issues - provide an easy way for Fedora users and contributors to obtain Fedora merchandise and help direct Fedora Ambassadors to vendors that are near them who can help fill bulk orders for events they attend. More details can be found on the Fedora SIG page."" [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-marketing-list/2008-February/msg00217.html === Generic Fedora Poster Designs for Events === MairinDuffy reports in fedora-marketing-list[1], ""I've updated the posters using the color suggestions from JohnAdams and the text [:PaulWFrields: PaulFrields] gave me in my blog (with one minor mod) and some layout suggestions from RobinNorwood in IRC (the original design had the infinity sign flattened, it's readjusted to resemble its position in the logo and some of the sizing of the logo elements is changed.)"" [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-marketing-list/2008-February/msg00202.html === Fedora Project releases alpha version of Fedora 9 === RahulSundaram reports in fedora-marketing-list[1], ""The GNOME programs in the alpha version of Fedora 9 are derived from the 2.21 development branch from which GNOME 2.22 should be emerging in mid March. The browser will be a preview version of Firefox 3, the core rendering elements of which are in a separate XULRunner package. Preview versions of other applications such as OpenOffice 2.4 or X-Server 1.5 are also used. The development team have also improved the installation program so that existing ext2, ext3 and NTFS partitions can now be reduced in size. In addition, it is now possible to create encrypted Linux partitions directly during installation."" [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-marketing-list/2008-February/msg00214.html === Fedora 9 Alpha Preview === RahulSundaram reports in fedora-marketing-list[1], ""Among the features being worked on are encrypted file-system support, updating the KDE spin to KDE 4.0, PackageKit integration, and switching to upstart initialization. In this article, we are taking a brief look at Fedora 9 Alpha and the features planned for Fedora 9."" [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-marketing-list/2008-February/msg00068.html === Fedora 9 Alpha - digg it === JonathanRoberts reports in fedora-marketing-list[1], ""Now that the Alpha is out and the release notes[2] are no longer a draft, how about we try and get it a bit of attention... If you find the information in the article useful, then why not drop by digg[3] and give it a vote :)"" [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-marketing-list/2008-February/msg00054.html [2] http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/9/Alpha/ReleaseNotes [3] http://digg.com/linux_unix/Fedora_9_Sulphur_Alpha_Released [[Anchor(Ambassadors)]] == Ambassadors == In this section, we cover Fedora Ambassadors Project. http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors Contributing Writer: JeffreyTadlock === LinuxTag 2008 Preparations === MaxSpevack posted to the Ambassadors list [1] asking for Ambassadors attending LinuxTag 2008, May 28th to the 31st, to add your name to the LinuxTag Rooms sign-up [2]. This is only for Ambassadors attending LinuxTag and the entire bill may not be compensated. Also posted to the Ambassadors list [3] was a call for participation and preliminary look at what is lined up for LinuxTag by Gerold Kassube. Highlights at LinuxTag are to inlude a troubleshooting contest, a mini-FUDcon, Fedora on a Mac, X-Box, OLPC, Eee-PC, a Fedora 9 showroom, meet the developer and more.

Nominations are being accepted February 9th through February 21st, with the election being held at FOSDEM 2008 on February 23rd. Additional information and the nomination page are available on the wiki [2]. [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-ambassadors-list/2008-February/msg00040.html [2] http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Ambassadors/EMEA/BoardElections [[Anchor(Developments)]] == Developments == In this section, we cover the problems/solutions, people/personalities, and ups/downs of the endless discussions on Fedora Developments. http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/fedora-devel-list Contributing Writer: OisinFeeley === Baracuda To Replace VNC ? === A query as to the status of the replacement of ''vnc'' by ''baracuda'' (note the single ""r"") in Fedora 9 was posted[1] by MikeC. Mike was concerned that there was no mention of either in the feature list and especially wanted to preserve the ability to load a vnc module in Xorg.conf so that the screen could be viewed remotely even without a user logging in via the display manager. [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00254.html Several replies focused on the client end of the equation and ignored the server part. DanielBerrange pointed out[2] that for GNOME the ''vinagre'' package is superior to the old RealVNC ''vncviewer'' as it can handle ''gnome-keyring'', ''avahi'' discovery and bookmarking of connections. KevinKofler and BenjaminKreuter responded[3] that on the KDE desktop the same functionality is provided by ''Krfb''. Benjamin hoped that ''vncviewer'' was going to be maintained in the repositories as there were scripts which depended on it. AdamTkac responded to DanielBerrange that the focus of ''baracuda'' was to produce a standalone Xvnc server with a libvnc.so module built against Xorg 1.5 and that the client was subsidiary. [2] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00259.html [3] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00266.html [4] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00337.html Mike pointed out[5] that a user needed to be logged in before ''krfb'' could be run and that his use case involved remote logins. [5] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00274.html AdamTkac, responding[6] directly to the original mail, gave an update on ''baracuda'', explaining that it was a fork forced by the need to have an Xorg-1.5 based vncserver and that the original upstream (RealVNC) were not maintaining the source. This is probably because they also sell an ""enterprise"" edition. The current Xvnc has thus accumulated a significant number of patches which Adam ,as Fedora maintainer, judged unacceptable. Seemingly other projects had made the same determination and once Adam announced[7] the Fedora fork the TightVNC project expressed[8] interest in merging his work and 
it seems this is going ahead. Mike greeted this good news with thanks to Adam for his work. [6] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00334.html [7] http://www.realvnc.com/pipermail/vnc-list/2008-February/058598.html [8] http://www.realvnc.com/pipermail/vnc-list/2008-February/058619.html === Sins Of Commission: Google Earth === A plea for the packaging of Google Earth[1] was made by DouglasMcClendon. He explained that he was short of time but thought it ought to be easy for someone to whip up a ''kickstart'' ''%post'' scriptlet to install Google Earth. A quick response from ChristopherBrown declined to attempt to package non-Free software: ""When [G]oogle actually release something open source other than obscure OCR software that sucks anyway I'll be more than happy to work a bit harder on stuff like that."" Christopher's comment became the focal point of the thread which echoed long-standing unease with Google Earth's non-Free binaries, its reliance upon further non-Free video-card drivers and its restrictive licensing terms on its data[2]. Douglas clarified[3] that what he was interested in was copying Debian's approach which is to use a properly licensed script which grabs the non-Free code, turns it into an rpm and then installs it. [1] http://earth.google.com/ [2] http://lwn.net/Articles/211153/ [3] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00367.html Christopher made it clear[4] that he was aware that what Douglas was requesting might not be so different from the ''autodownload'' scriptlets on the Fedora Games DVD which pull non-Free game data and asked how far down the slippery slope it was proposed to travel. He described[5] the method as a circumvention of Fedora policy. AndrewFarris agreed[6] that the package should not be in the Fedora repositories but did wish that someone would package it in some other repository. He also disagreed that Google Earth and the ''autodownload'' scripts were the same as in the former case the actual program code is unavailable whereas in the latter the code is available and all that is missing is some data. Douglas largely agreed, suggested[7] the Livna repository as a good place and wished that someone would port NASA's ''worldwind''[8]. [4] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00368.html [5] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00371.html [6] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00374.html [7] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00378.html [8] http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/index.html ToshioKuratomi summed up[9] the situation concisely and noted that HansdeGoede 's script was ""controversial"". TomCallaway's opinion was[10] that the distinction between data and code was a fine, but important one and OlivierGalibert thinned it even further when he asked[11] ""How much of this data is code for a virtual machine?"". Further exploration led ChristopherAillon to state that the games supplied are supposed to have enough data to be somewhat useful without the restricted data and KevinKofler to state[12] that in practice this was not the case. Kevin listed several possible problems in this regard and suggested that anyone objecting should take it up with FESCo. [9] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00373.html [10] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00393.html [11] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00394.html [12] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00423.html The situation, as described, was thought by JesseKeating to be unacceptable and Toshio responded[13] that if FESCo were going to revisit the issue then it would be wise and fair to ensure that Hans were available during the discussion as he was shouldering the burden of any work and needed to understand the requirements. Responding to a request from TomCallaway for specifics, KevinKofler ran a quick {{{repoquery --whatrequires autodownloader}}} and listed[14] five games which have licenses which restrict the distribution of their data and are useless without it. AlanCox did not think the situation was so clear cut and posited[15] that a better test was to ask ""whether it is possible to produce new free data sets for [such tools]."" He later expanded[16] upon this with examples and with the correction that the important condition was ""practicality"" rather than ""possibility."" [13] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00471.html [14] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00481.html [15] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00519.html [16] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00623.html === Autodownloader vs. CodecBuddy === A thread to specifically discuss the ethical and practical problems posed by the use of ''autodownloader'' (see this FWN#119 ""Sins Of Commission: Google Earth"") was opened[1] by HansdeGoede. Hans explained that his own guideline for the use of autodownloader was that it was ""only for content [...] for Free engines."" He thought that while CodecBuddy (also known as Codeina[2]) was included in the distribution it was hypocritical to worry about autodownloader. He emphasized that Codeina downloads closed-source code and also offers the user the option to purchase said code, effectively advertising closed-source. [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00476.html [2] http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Multimedia/Codeina A longish sub-thread started[3] by JakubRusinek worked over the exhausted topic of whether or not Codeina/CodecBuddy can do anything further to facilitate the installation of possibly patent-encumbered codecs. There was nothing particularly new to see here, with the situation remaining as it has since the last opinion from Red Hat ""legal"" which implies that the current web page can obliquely explain the problem but needs to beware of contributory infringement. RahulSundaram supplied[4] a link to the relevant post. Unless the interpretation of software as both machine and copyrightable work (see AlanCox's post[5]) in the U.S.A. were to be miraculously overthrown then such discussion appears moot, as do comparisons to the non-US based Canonical. [3] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00480.html [4] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00540.html [5] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00523.html A bizarrely formatted post made by TrondDanielsen suggested[6] that the pursuit of the Online Desktop[7] was another example of the hypocrisy and grey areas to which Hans had alluded. MatejCepl reacted[8] harshly, rebutting Trond's assertion that there was a partnership with Google, or that the purpose was to integrate Flickr and Google with the rest of the desktop. Trond's civil, self-deprecating response explained[9] that ""The purpose of the argument was that Fedora already depend on proprietary services and software which makes the argument against the autodownloader invalid"" but HorstvonBrand undermined[10] the validity of the argument and explained that while a daily beating with the cluestick may be beneficial to recipients it is tiring for the administrator. [6] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00492.html [7] http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/FeatureOnlineDesktop [8] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00545.html [9] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00558.html [10] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00570.html There were several voices raised in favor of removing Codeina/CodecBuddy. Among them were Dexter[11] and KevinKofler[12]. Kevin added that web browsers should be prevented from offering to install the proprietary flash plugins as there was a Yum repository facilitating cleaner installs. JefSpaleta grew tired[13] of the strained comparisons between different pieces of software. ChrisAdams thought that picking on Adobe's Flash (especially when they provide such a repository) would prevent him from being able to use Fedora in his job. He pointed out that ''swfdec'' and other free software Flash players cannot support MP3 audio until possibly 2017. BrianPepple pointed[14] out that the gstreamer plugin was available, just not included in Fedora due to legal reasons and so the thread came full circle to the issue of licensing. Rahul provided links and wondered[15] if this conversation had to occur every few weeks. [11] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00479.html [12] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00544.html [13] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00588.html [14] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00648.html [15] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00673.html === The Point Of Mock === An interesting short thread was started[1] by KellyMiller (lightsolphoenix). Kelly sought advice on how to write the spec file for a KDE3 package destined for both Fedora 8 and rawhide now that the package names have changed. IgnacioVazquezAbrams suggested[2] using a ''%{dist}'' tag and JarodWilson added[3] that BuildRequires did not need to be versioned to catch devel packages less than version 3. [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00286.html [2] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00287.html [3] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00290.html As a subsidiary issue Kelly mentioned[4] that there seemed to be problems with the ability of ''mock'' to build x86_64 packages. Jarod and Jesse both wondered whether he was on an x86 machine and it seemed that he was. Kelly mused[5] ""I was under the impression that the whole point of using Mock was to handle that situation"". Jesse responded[6] ""No, the whole point of mock is to create clean chroots each time you want to build. The x86_64 platforms ability to run i386 code is a side effect."" KevinKofler observed[7] that running ''qemu'' allowed (at the expense of a massive speed penalty) the building of x86_64 code on an i386 platform. [4] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00297.html [5] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00329.html [6] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00331.html [7] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00347.html === Glade 2 And Glade 3 Co-existence === DebarshiRay (rishi) drew attention[1] to the dependency of the latest ''anjuta'' on ''glade3''[2] and requested that the replacement of ''glade2'' by ''glade3'' be considered. Debarshi thought this would affect the Developer Live spin and the regular GNOME DVD spin. [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00308.html [2] Glade is a RAD tool to develop GTK GUIs: http://glade.gnome.org/ MatthiasClasen asked[3] whether ''glade3'' could handle all the files produced by ''glade2''. TimWaugh confirmed[4] that although this seemed to work he had seen problems with the converse, where files touched or produced by ''glade3'' were not rendered correctly by ''glade2''. [3] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00309.html [4] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00326.html The suggestion by Debarshi that it might be prudent to split Anjuta up or drop it entirely was thought[5] by Matthias not to be necessary as the two glade versions might be able to co-exist. JeremyKatz was happy that there was plenty of space on the DVD for both versions[6]. [5] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00311.html [6] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00320.html === Dropping FUSE Group? Security Concerns === As the upcoming GNOME VFS will use FUSE as a backend PeterLemenkov proposed[1] to drop the Fuse group as otherwise all users would need to be added to this group. He asked for objections to be made known. [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00237.html Initial concern was expressed by WarrenTogami on the foot of the affect this might have on KDE users. He also wondered how upgrades would be affected. ThorstenLeemhuis asked[3] whether a security audit had been conducted as he had suggested some time ago. KarelZak reported[4] that MiklosSzeredi's work on a non-root-privileged mount (which could be used by FUSE) was making its way into the --mm kernel tree. He also made some interesting observations on the Fedora Project package process. MattDomsch suggested[5] a Koji equivalent of ''rpmlint'' to search for suid problems. [2] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00239.html [3] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00240.html [4] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00278.html [5] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00442.html AlexanderLarsson argued[6] that Thorsten's security worries were only tangentially related to FUSE itself and had more to do with inappropriate use of setuid. He added that SELinux policy for ''fusermount'' would be a possibly useful enhancement. Alex also provided[7] the information that it was actually ''GVFS'', a replacement to ''GNOME VFS'' which was under discussion and explained its workings. [6] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00306.html [7] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00296.html KevinKofler called[8] the FUSE group ""plugdev reloaded"" and outlined the problem of having to add users manually. [8] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00382.html Further questioning by Warren as to the implications of the change for users of non-GNOME desktops drew[9] a reply from Alexander to the effect that it was an orthogonal issue and Kevin provided some backing on this point with the comparison of KIO functionality. [9] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2008-February/msg00387.html An excellent summary was made[10] by Alexander in which he pointed out that FUSE provides desired features that GNOME and other software are currently using and that Fedora's security fears will lead to either ""punching users in the face"" by shipping a setup which they need to correct manually or else just not shipping the software. SteveGrubb replied[11] that the Common Criteria[12] evaluations were for specific mounting mechanisms and that this new, parallel method might necessitate Steve doing a lot of extra, unplanned work. A meaty, information-filled series of posts followed. Alexander described[13], in another excellent post, the benefits of FUSE, Steve pointed[14] to a potential problem with SELinux auditing and wondered whether FUSE was duplicating some pre-existing functionality in sharing files over SSH, but without the benefit of auditing mechanisms. Alexander's last mail[15] (as of publication date) was a detailed apparent rebuttal of Steve's concerns which emphasized the role of FUSE in exposing non-root users to filesystems which were otherwise awkward to access.

list where are all of the Fedora re-spins?[1] To date there is just Fedora Games, Fedora Developer, and Fedora Electronic Lab editions. JeffSpaleta had responded saying that a number of localized editions are being worked on, and an Xfce spin is being worked on but was facing technical struggles that has been fixed recently. Jeff also highlighted that a education spin has been proposed recently[2]. RahulSundaram had also commented that Fedora Lite, Security Spin, and Fedora Art Studio are also on the road-map.[3] [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-advisory-board/2008-February/msg00043.html [2] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-advisory-board/2008-February/msg00044.html [3] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-advisory-board/2008-February/msg00049.html === Fedora Education Spin, SIG === AxelThimm had asked about establishing a SIG (Special Interest Group) for those interested in bringing Fedora to schools[1]. Announced just four days later, however, was a Fedora Education spin as well as intending to form a Fedora Education SIG[2]. [1] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-advisory-board/2008-February/msg00026.html [2] https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-advisory-board/2008-February/msg00060.html [[Anchor(Documentation)]] == Documentation == In this section, we cover the Fedora Documentation Project. http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/DocsProject Contributing Writer: JohnBabich === Meeting to Discuss Publican === PaulFrields asked [1]: ""Can Fedora Documentation folks be available next Wednesday evening [13 February] after hours (EST) for an ad hoc meeting about the new RH Docs team's ""publican"" documentation tools? You'll especially want to attend if: * You're on the [Fedora Docs] steering committee * You do (or intend to) work on the Release Notes or other formal documentation"" A time is being set for the meeting, keeping in mind that the Red Hat Docs team is in Brisbane, Australia in the UTC+10 time zone. Interested people should respond via the Fedora Docs mailing list by Tuesday, 12 February, at the latest. Note that ""publican"" does not refer to a tax collector or a pub owner. Rather, Publican is a completely unencumbered FOSS tool chain for producing documentation for open-source, as well as commercial, software projects. Publican is composed of common files and scripts for building documentation using the Doc``Book XML format. [1]http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-docs-list/2008-February/msg00051.html === Encryption and Privacy Guide Input === After he finished making updates to the Encryption and Privacy Guide (EPG)[1] and requested input, EricChristensen responded [2] to KarstenWade's remarks asking for more Fedora-specific content. ""Here is what I propose... In order to provide a comprehensive guide that covers privacy and encryption that is available to Fedora I think we should cover in depth the Fedora-specific information while providing a summary and alternate paths for getting information for items that are more Linux-specific."" There is already non-Fedora-specific information in our Docs (like a guide for using GPG ...[3]...) that could be rolled into the EPG as a summary. This would allow a guide that would be encompassing while not rewriting the book on everything security."" KarstenWade replied [4]: ""I don't see a problem with this idea. You understand what the catch is and avoid it with the summary approach...One way we could help the users is to identify the background they may want to skip and make it easy for them to learn how to skip it.""

The plan...looks like this: Create a wiki page... Flesh out that page with sections for: a) Press Release style summary b) Detailed Overview covering all features on / Releases / # / Feature List either alphabetically or by coolness... c) Technical Summary - brief but aimed at tech journalists d) Detailed Technical Summary - detailed and aimed at geeks, similar to release notes content now. .

Thank you for this post. My previous experience with virtualization
software has been frustrating, to say the list. Following your
instructions, the software installed without any problemd.

As a new user, I tired to configure too many options at once. The only
initial configuration required was mounting the dvd drive and selecting
ALSA as the sound device.

To access my home directory and the printer, I had to do a network
setup. Is this the the best way or are there better alternatives?

As regards the network cards, sound cards and other such equipment, is
it possible to have direct access in vbox or does this cause problems
with the host system?

YaST --> Software Management --> Search: apt

The problem is where to find software in format that apt understands.

Hello Finally I solve the problem of the compilation of Weka, and I also introduce the new filter (filter.java), in the Filters folders, Now I want to create the .jar document of the complete Weka with my new filter, I generate the jar file and when I try to execute it have this error:

Failed to lad Main Class manifiest atribute 

Somebody knows how I have to generate this .jar file properly?

Mark/Peter,

Is it possible to integrate gridregression.py (or a similar tool), which is a tool under LIBSVM for finding the optimized parameters of c, gamma and epsilon, into WEKA?

Hi. 

Most likely this is a case of overfitting (overtraining): 
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting): ""especially in cases where 
learning was performed too long or where training examples are rare, the 
learner may adjust to very specific random features of the training data, 
that have no causal relation to the target function."" 

Overfitting in back-propagation neural networks like MLP (resulting in 
prediction bias toward one/some of the target classes) can be caused by the 
following: if misclassified training instances continue to be misclassified 
iteration after iteration, they get overweighted and actually take weight 
from the correctly classified instances, i.e. the weights become 
imbalanced. Furthermore, if misclassified instances happen to be clearly 
concentrated to some classes, this can result in confusion matrix that you 
quoted (zero correct instances for some classes). 

> I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this. 

MLP describes the parameters as follows: ""learningRate -- The amount the 
weights are updated. momentum -- Momentum applied to the weights during 
updating. decay -- This will cause the learning rate to decrease. This will 
divide the starting learning rate by the epoch number, to determine what 
the current learning rate should be. This may help to stop the network from 
diverging from the target output, as well as improve general performance."" 

As far as I know, no off-the-shelf formula exists for optimizing these 
parameters. It is an interchange of parameters and the dataset. If you are 
looking for a pattern in performance, consider that the parameters operate 
together (learning rate * momentum / decay) so that the first two operate 
for controlling speed of change and the latter for stopping the change. 

""Ultimately, the cost function will depend on the task we wish to perform."" 
(wiki). If you are getting as high as > 85% accuracies from most 
configurations, this suggests that optimal training model for this dataset 
is produced when the parameters are set on 'fast burn' (few iterations) so 
I would say higher learning rate * momentum and fast decay work best (do 
they?).

You are right. I just checked cygwin's rename() code and it is
convincing enough for me to withdraw the patch.

Thanks for all the comments.

FWIW, I had an HP dv6000 with hardware problems, and when I made the support 
call I did tell them I was running linux though I resisted any suggestions to 
try Windows and forced them to diagnose it anyways.

When I got my ticket to send it in for service, I pulled the drive altogether 
and placed a sticky on it saying ""HDD removed for corporate policy reasons"".

They fixed my system and sent it back three days later.

If you have a hardware problem, don't bother including the drive. They can 
troubleshoot it without it, and it keeps them from sending it back 
saying ""WON'T FIX"" because you have linux on it.

Just my 2c...

from perlretut...

Non-capturing groupings

We noted in Part 1 that groupings ""()"" had two distinct
functions: 1) group regexp elements together as a single unit, and 2)
extract, or capture, substrings that matched the regexp in the
grouping. Non-capturing groupings, denoted by ""(?:regexp)"", allow
the regexp to be treated as a single unit, but don't extract
substrings or set matching variables $1, etc. Both capturing and
non-capturing groupings are allowed to co-exist in the same
regexp. Because there is no extraction, non-capturing groupings are
faster than capturing groupings....

I spoke too soon. :( I was on a site and it all looked like a ""go"" with 
KNetworkmanger. No.....NOT so lucky. Maybe the problem is in 
Knetworkmanager after all.

213,"Thomas Ledbetter <htjdyuac@revelstone.net>","Postfix users <rljdsng-xyqoh@postfix.org>","BCC mail 'storms'","Hi! Im wondering what advice anyone has regarding this issue:

When one of our users sends an email with a large amount of local
users listed in the BCC that contains a sizable attachment, it can
sometimes trigger a 'bcc storm'. 

We have a single F5 load balancer that various services flow through.
A single email transaction can 'loop' through one piece of equipment
multiple times. When one of these 'bcc storms' takes place, because of
this 'looping', it can max out the interfaces to the F5.

We've taken some measures to prevent this by reducing the number of
different types of services that pass through our load balancer, and
reverted to using RR DNS instead.

But Im wondering what else can be done. Taking a look at the q-shape
postfix readme, I see discussion regarding the
'default_destination_concurrency_limit' parameter which sounds
promising, but it affects *all* destinations.

It there any way to control concurrency limits on a per-host basis?","",0,0,0,2025-07-26T19:57:39.705Z,1753559859084,1753559859701,0.617

What link? The spample does not show any. Also, the DNS queries relevant
for SA are those to the various blacklists. By default including URI as
well as IP blacklists.

Anyway, you can't prove the non-existence of a DNS issue, by one
successful query. So we now know that it works at least sometimes. Good,
we pretty much knew that before. ;)

Did you try asking qmail-scanner folks already? That is not the default

smtpd restrictions only apply to mail sent via smtp. if squirrelmail 
uses the sendmail command, then that won't work. and since squirrelmail 
always exectutes as the same user (your webserver uid), there's not much 
to do except finding a way for squirrelmail to implement the restriction.

Does MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING mean the rename over an existing file is actually
atomic? I cannot find any MSDN docs that say so (and I've seen some that
suggest to me that it probably isn't).

If it's not atomic, then this doesn't offer any advantage over shutil.move that
I can see (and in fact would damage the usefulness of os.rename, which is
currently atomic on all platforms AFAIK, even though it cannot succeed all the
time).

If MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING miraculously turns out to be atomic, then my
opinion is:

* this feature would be very useful, and I would like a cross-platform way to
do this in Python.
* this feature should not be called ""os.rename"", which for years has done
something else on some platforms, and so changing it will invite unnecessary
breakage. A new function would be better, or perhaps an optional flag. I
propose ""os.atomic_rename"".

Also, I assume this cannot replace files that are in use?

I'd be ok with a flag, but it should have a cross-platform name.
""require_atomic"" or ""replace"" or something like that. I think a new function
makes more sense, though.

I don't quite follow what you're saying here, but I'd be against an operation
called ""rename"" that sometimes was atomic and sometimes wasn't.

Does MoveFileEx solve the atomicity problem that Guido raised in that thread? I
don't think it does, so I think the situation is still the same.

I have submitted a patch (http://www.python.org/sf/1704547) that
allows os.rename to replace the destination file if it exists, on
windows. As part of discussion in the tracker, Martin suggested that
python-dev should discuss the change.

Currently, os.rename() on windows uses the API MoveFile() which fails
if the destination file exists. The patch replaces this API with
MoveFileEx() and uses the flag MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING which causes
the destination file to be replaced if it exists. However, this change
is subtle and if there is any existing code that depends on current
os.rename behaviour on windows, their code is silently broken with
(any) destination file being overwritten. But the functionality of
replacing is important and I would like to know the best of way of
supporting it. If it is deemed that this change is not good to go in
as-is, how about having an optional parameter to os.rename (say,
win_replace) that can be used by callers to explicitly request
replacing?

I must also point out that the patch uses another flag
MOVEFILE_COPY_ALLOWED effectively allowing renamed files to be on
separate file systems. The renaming in this case is not atomic and I
used this flag only to support current functionality. It is not a bad
idea to disallow such renames which brings it in line with the
behaviour on many unix flavors. This also has the potential to break
code but not silently.

Lastly, I found an old discussion about the same topic by this list.

http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-dev/2001-May/014957.html

Even though Guido indicated that he doesn't support API change in this
thread, I am posting again as I did not see any one mention
MoveFileEx() in that thread.

Thanks,
Raghu.

hmm. hurt like hell? I think that's very Dr. specific. I got a shot that 
was eased in slowly, front loaded with lidocane, back loaded with 
cortisone. It was almost painless, the pain I was experiencing before 
the shot disappeared almost immediately due to the lidocane, and then 
disappeared in a more ongoing basis due to the cortisone. Magic.

Yes. Sorry, I didn't post an update because I was embarrassed at my own
stupidity for not thinking it through more carefully before posting my
original message. Switching the jobs round did indeed mean that sa-learn
is no longer getting interfered with by archivemail while it's in
mid-learn. It now behaves quite sensibly.

Yes I understand that. It's not that I *keep* a temp folder of spam/ham, I
don't. I know that it only needs to learn the *new* mails. It's just that
I'm basically lazy, and it seemed far easier for me simply to take all
my non-spam folders and copy them together into one big temporary
file, run sa-learn on it and then delete the temporary file, eg:

#!/bin/bash
cat ~/mail/mailinglists/* ~/mail/WorkStuff/* ~/mail/Admin/* > TempHam
sa-learn --ham --mbox ~/mail/TempHam
rm ~/mail/TempHam

I'm no bash-scripting wiz (that much should be obvious!) so I could
think of no *easy* way to strip only today's mails out of my 20-odd
folders and just feed those to sa-learn. My way, I need to do nothing
myself, the job takes about half an hour, and I'm asleep when it
happens... OK, sa-learn has to work a bit harder than it needs to, but
hey, better it than me!

The 180 days thing is because I choose to keep only the last 6 months
(approx) mail in each of my 20 or so folders, the rest being zipped into a gzip
archive using ""Archivemail"" (a very neat little utility btw) and 180 days is
its default setting (see I told you I was lazy!).

Could it be that during installation IPv6 is not enabled?
At work aswell as at home i've my own installation-server / gwdg-mirror.
Identical setup, but at home i use for all my vhosts an V6 address.

After a system is installed, i can upgrade or add aditional repo's
without any problem with my IPv6 servers.

However during the initial installation the installation source coming
froman IPv6 address are not recognised.

If i perform a DVD-installation, just before the first boot, i saw that
the module ""ipv6"" is not loaded. 
I presume this could be the reason.

Any suggestions how i can load this module in grub before installation
takes place, so that i can add my own installationsources?

Doesn't seem complicated... I've never done a sed script. I was thinking 
of doing it in pascal, just for the laugh of it, but sed would 
maintainable by others if needed.

Yes...

I could work on the ""file.in"" file, and the Makefile would handle whatever 
it currently does, plus the conversion, producing the file.1

It should. But it also should exist a man/troff editor for dummies: it 
doesn't even require graphics, it could be done in a terminal. It is a 
vetust format, a reliq of times well past, but here it is, alive and 
kicking. Specially that, kicking me.



I have seen a procedure to generate troff out of opendocument format (in 
the Heirloom Project). I haven't tested it, but I wonder. If that works, 
it would make things like spell checking much easier.

Please provide informations instead of literature. I am happy that 
everything contains the right value for you, but this brings us nowhere. 
so I'll repeat myself.

- print the value of $mailbox (to logs or whatever) so that you see what 
it is.
- ls -la /mnt/gluster/$mailbox/ ... etc
.

and _show_ the results. and while I am in,

- what system are you running? is selinux/apparamor/... enabled?

There are many different setups out there. if the whole mailstore 
belongs to vmail, then under a standard unix, vmail can do everything in 
the mailstore.","[]",0,0,0,2025-07-26T20:07:51.806Z,1753560471226,1753560471800,0.574

=========================================

The man who would be prime minister in a month or so if an electon is called, and if he wins, has spoken.

David Cameron carried off that public school accomplishment of speaking without hesitation, deviation or repetition - and without a script.

Remarkable enough in front of an audience reduced from Mrs Thatcher's 3,000 in Blackpool to 1,200. And he is unashamed to say how much he admires Eton, although he didn't name it - he just said it was a fantastic school.

He also revealed himself to be a Jimmy Cliff fan, one of the few areas of repetition involving the following famous phrase, 'You can get it if you really want.'

Cathy Newman is in Blackpool, savouring the aftermath of the Cameron speech and assessing whether he was wise to call on Mr Brown to have an immediate election - doesn't that make it harder to attack him for needlessly calling an election when he does?

We'll be assessing where we are regarding election campaigns, tensions, possibilities and more with Ken Clarke, Vince Cable and David Blunkett. Not just the �will he, won�t he?� debate, but the �should he, shouldn�t he?� - which is much more interesting.

Diana inquest latest
================

The Diana inquest rolls on and new footage and photos of the scene of her end are revealed.

Jane Dodge is down there, observing the coming and goings, not the least of which is Harrods owner muttering that the Royal Family murdered his son Dodi.

But it must be admitted he's done pretty well to get the inquiry even as far as this - even if in the end, as the judge put it, there was little doubt that the driver of the death car had indeed drunk alcohol.

Burma: new pictures
================

Talking of new video, there is new footage out of Burma and it's pretty horrid and pretty revealing. Jonathan Miller is looking at it and reporting on it from Bangkok.

Sex traffickers targeted
=====================

New figures reveal the horrific scale of the trafficking in women, particularly those from the erstwhile Eastern Block.

Once again, the spotlight fails to fall on the men who exploit them although police have today launched a new initiative to try to track the trafficking gangs.

Bye bye Blackpool
===============

Finally, we return to Blackppool to say goodbye.

Alas the other centres of population in Britain have so spruced up their conference capacity that Blackpool is falling by the wayside. And having lost the opportunity to sully its fine reputation with a giant casino, it is now losing the party conferences as well.

Nicholas Glass reports on one of the great political venues of our time.

Best wishes
Jon Snow

I notice you cite my post; I stick to what I wrote: Postfix (2.5 in my 
case) has no trouble with dkim-milter 2.4.3 and mailings to over 1000 
LDAP posixGroup based recipients at a time. But Unix sockets have given 
problems in the past, inet none. And all my dkim-milter based stuff is 
called out of master.cg, not main.cf. dkim-milter is called by my last 
smtpd listener before the message goes to cleanup.

Best,
