Content-Type: text/plain

Hi 

I am trying to classify a data set with 3 classes with the
Multilayerperceptron algorithm using the Weka data mining programm. I am
testing various parameter settings to see which one yields the best
results. I am experimenting with various learning rates, momentums and
delay on/off. So far most of the parameter combinations yielded good
results of around 85% correctly classified instances.

But every once in a while I find a combination of parameters where the
classification doesnt work at all and one (sometimes even two) class(es)
seems to be left out of the process and the confusion matrix looks like
the following:

a b c <-- classified as
0 6838 4 | a = '(-inf-0.25]'
0 6728 72 | b = '(0.25-0.75]'
0 2141 4952 | c = '(0.75-inf)'

I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this. 

What can be the reason for such behaviour?

David

I've installed J2se Runtime environment 5 update14 in my computer, and set
the environment variable listed below
user variables
Variable name- PATH
Variable value- c:\\program files\\weka-3-5
However the same error persists.
