Ouch, that would hurt my arthritic joints something terrible. Can it wait till 
I've had a chance to hit my thumbs with another cortisone shot? On second 
thought, the iron bar is less painful in the short term. The last time I 
checked, they wanted to do surgery at $5k per thumb and I said how about 
cortisone? He said then (15 years ago) that it was $60 a shot, and it would 
hurt like hell. He was right on both counts, but that thumb still works 
today. Now its the other ones turn I guess. :)

Sorry, must have missed this along the way - didn't see any reference to

A friend is using the Home edition and I haven't ""played"" with it 
(because I didn't want to get tangled up with Home edition :-) ) so 
cannot comment for or against that you have both Admin and user accounts 
on it. All I know is what I heard, and read (and quoted above) about the 
Home edition of XP.

Of course, it is in XP Professional that most people who use it at home 
who never get past the first account - the Administrator - and do not 
create a user with limited access rights.

The need to create a normal, limited access, user in XP Professional is 
not something which is enforced in Professional which is why, I 
understand, most XP Prof. setups are being run by a home user with full 
Admin. rights. I cannot see why the Home edition should be more security 
conscious than the Professional edition, and also cost much less, unless 
SP1 and SP2 introduced the ability to create limited-access users in the 
Home edition.

Ciao.

Message-ID: <1202445584.28437.4.camel@poelzd-desktop> Content-Type: text/plain Hi I am trying to classify a data set with 3 classes with the Multilayerperceptron algorithm using the Weka data mining programm. I am testing various parameter settings to see which one yields the best results. I am experimenting with various learning rates, momentums and delay on/off. So far most of the parameter combinations yielded good results of around 85% correctly classified instances. But every once in a while I find a combination of parameters where the classification doesnt work at all and one (sometimes even two) class(es) seems to be left out of the process and the confusion matrix looks like the following: a b c <-- classified as 0 6838 4 | a = '(-inf-0.25]' 0 6728 72 | b = '(0.25-0.75]' 0 2141 4952 | c = '(0.75-inf)' I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this.

When I'm forced to use bayes in a large setup I prefer to go with per 
domain databases for domains with more than a couple of users and use a 
global database for all of the domains with only a few users each.

The cygwin implementation of rename goes like this:

1) Try to use MoveFile
2) Try to use MoveFileEx(..., MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)
3) Try to unlink destination, then try to use MoveFile

And as you say, Cygwin claims it meets POSIX.1. And, POSIX.1 says, ""If 
newpath already exists it will be atomically replaced (subject to
a few conditions; see ERRORS below), so that there is no point at which 
another process attempting to access newpath will find it missing."" 
Clearly, unliking and then calling MoveFile is not atomic. So, cygwin is 
not being honest here because in these less frequent cases, the rename 
will not be atomic.

Also note, MVCRT only tries step 1 of cygwin's version. Which I believe 
also suggests that it's the only version that is atomic.

---------------
About SSL tests
---------------

An open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep
open. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a
'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the
terminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform
Subprocess Termination`).

Contributing thread:

- `About SSL tests
`__

-------------------------------------
Cross-Platform Subprocess Termination
-------------------------------------

Because os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows
platforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows
platforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.
Support was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-
platform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually
incorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was
given.

Contributing thread:

- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)

------------------------
Extended buffer protocol
------------------------

Updates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP
documenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the
plans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.

(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real
degree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants
to add to the summary, it will stay short.)

Contributing threads:

- `Extended buffer PEP
`__
- `PEP 3118: Extended buffer protocol (new version)
`__
- `Extended Buffer Protocol - simple use examples
`__

-----------------------------------------
function for counting items in a sequence
-----------------------------------------

A patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),
implemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping
between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were
suggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of
items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning
due to a just-makes-sense factor.

Contributing thread:

- `function for counting items in a sequence
`__

----------------------------------------
context manager - generator interaction?
----------------------------------------

A problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside
the with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context
manager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist
without the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of
a formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.

Contributing thread:

- `context manager - generator interaction?
`__

-----------------------------
proposed which.py replacement
-----------------------------

Suggestion of replacing the which.py script in the Tools directory migrated to
its proposal for inclusion into the standard library. A patch and tests have
yet to be provided.

Contributing thread:

- `proposed which.py replacement
`_

-----------------------
minidom and DOM level 2
-----------------------

What is missing for DOM Level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and
some work jumpstarted.

Contributing thread:

- `minidom and DOM level 2
`__

----------------------------------------------
test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
----------------------------------------------

Differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose
mode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes
before a waitpid() call.

Er.. So I have a rail of ""ok"" but Test::More still thinks there's a
failing test.


OTOH, the same failures occur with 5.5.3 so at least they weren't
introduced by 5.5.5

Yes. Sorry, I didn't post an update because I was embarrassed at my own
stupidity for not thinking it through more carefully before posting my
original message. Switching the jobs round did indeed mean that sa-learn
is no longer getting interfered with by archivemail while it's in
mid-learn. It now behaves quite sensibly.

Yes I understand that. It's not that I *keep* a temp folder of spam/ham, I
don't. I know that it only needs to learn the *new* mails. It's just that
I'm basically lazy, and it seemed far easier for me simply to take all
my non-spam folders and copy them together into one big temporary
file, run sa-learn on it and then delete the temporary file, eg:

#!/bin/bash
cat ~/mail/mailinglists/* ~/mail/WorkStuff/* ~/mail/Admin/* > TempHam
sa-learn --ham --mbox ~/mail/TempHam
rm ~/mail/TempHam

I'm no bash-scripting wiz (that much should be obvious!) so I could
think of no *easy* way to strip only today's mails out of my 20-odd
folders and just feed those to sa-learn. My way, I need to do nothing
myself, the job takes about half an hour, and I'm asleep when it
happens... OK, sa-learn has to work a bit harder than it needs to, but
hey, better it than me!

The 180 days thing is because I choose to keep only the last 6 months
(approx) mail in each of my 20 or so folders, the rest being zipped into a gzip
archive using ""Archivemail"" (a very neat little utility btw) and 180 days is
its default setting (see I told you I was lazy!).

Thanks, applied _to my svn repo_ :)

I don't have blead commit bits, but I'll present a new tarball for

Hello list,

I run a small mail server with clamd used to scan the incomming and outgoing
email. I recently noticed that I had stopped receiving my logwatch daily
digest. I looked into it and clam is stopping it claiming its phishing. Is
there any way to find out what part of the email may be triggering this so I
can change it in the logwatch config?

Your clamd log should reveal the virus name found. Once you know that it 
may be possible to decode the pattern to discover what is being found in 
your logwatch mail. It may also be possible to instruct your system to 
not scan mail from logwatch.

Two questions just to clarify...

Does output of the ""clamconf"" command contain:
PhishingScanURLs = yes


If you stop/restart clamd does it still miss the sample?

Interesting. PhishingScanURLs was no (hard coded), changing it to yes 
makes clamdscan see it.

How ever the reason I saw it was because a message came in on mail 
server 3 last night and was not caught, but the message was then 
forwarded to a user on mail server 2 where it was rejected by clamdscan.

Now, mail server 2 did not see the virus this morning when I checked it 
again but it obviously did last night when PhishingScanURLs = no.

Any reason for that that you can see ?

Rick

Editor's Note


Prizes and Awards: It's That Time of Year


'Tis the season for prizes, or so it seems anyway. For starters, Edmund M. Clarke, E. Allen Emerson, and Joseph Sifakis received the 2007 Turing Award, the granddaddy of all computing awards, for their work on model checking, an automated technique for finding design errors in complex hardware and software. They share a $250,000 prize.
Moving from computing to mathematics, Pierre Deligne, Phillip Griffiths, and David Mumford are sharing the 2008 Wolf Foundation Prize in Mathematics. Deligne was honored ""for his work on mixed Hodge theory, the Weil conjectures, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, and for his contributions to arithmetic,"" Griffiths ""for his work on variations of Hodge structures; the theory of periods of abelian integrals; and for his contributions to complex differential geometry,"" and Mumford ""for his work on algebraic surfaces; on geometric invariant theory; and for laying the foundations of the modern algebraic theory of moduli of curves and theta functions."" The three share a $100,000 award.
This year's Crafoord Prize combined the fields of abstract mathematics with astrophysics. Maxim Kontsevich and Edward Witten received the 2008 Crafoord Prize in Mathematics from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, while Rashid Sunyaev received the Crafoord Prize in Astronomy. Kontsevich and Witten were cited ""for their important contributions to mathematics inspired by modern theoretical physics."" Half of the $500,000 prize goes to Kontsevich and Witten, the other half to Sunyaev.
Back in the field of computing, the 2007 Gordon Bell Prize went to a team of scientists--Kyle Caspersen, James Glosli, John Gunnels, David Richards, Robert Rudd, and Frederick Streitz--from Lawrence Livermore National Lab and IBM for a unique simulation of a phenomenon known as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the BlueGene/L. These gents will divvy up a $10,000 prize.
And finally, there's the Dr. Dobb's Excellence In Programming Award, given this year to....uh, I can't tell you. It is still a secret. But the recipient will be honored in the upcoming April 2008 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal and in person at the SD West 2008 Conference on Wednesday, March 5, 2008. For a list of previous recipients, visit Dr. Dobb's Hall of Fame. 
Congratulations to one and all for well-deserved honors.

vb allows you to specify ""Shared Folders"". Just open vb, select the 
guest os you want to specify a shared folder for and then click on the 
""Shared Folders"" and then chose the folder you want to share between the 
host and guest os.

I have a little network that has plenty of samba shares available so I 
just use a folder on a samba share. Works great both from linux and the 
guest os XP.

I was amazed that the guest XP networking was 100% functional from 
within vb. No configuration required on that end. Just use windows 
explorer and with folder view and pick ""my networks"" ""entire network"" 
""windows networks"" the just pick your ""workgroup"" expand it and all your 
computers are there!

There's not much point in hiding the SSID, as it doesn't do much to stop
attackers. It also means that a neighbour, looking for a clear spot to
put his WiFi, might chose the same channel as yours. The best way to
get WiFi security, is to use WPA (WPA2 if possible), which is very
secure. WEP is not. I've also got my home WiFi (WPA2) on the outside
of my firewall, so SSH, with public key authentication or OpenVPN are
required to reach my network.

Goutam Baul <uelsuu.cjgy@cesc.co.in>,rljdsng-xyqoh@postfix.org,2008-08-06 5:12:35,Mail Sending problem,"Hello Everybody,

I am using RHEL 4 with postfix postfix-2.2.10-1.RHEL4.2. The authentication
is being done using openldap and courier packages are being used for pop and
imap. Maildrop is the mail delivery agent. The packages details are given

I have implemented SASL authetication. Trend Micro Net Suit is being used as
the anti spam/anti virus software. Since last few days I am finding that
some of the users (out of total 900+ users 3 has reported the issue so far)
are not able to send mail to any address outside of my domain. The log entry
that I am getting is something like

Feb 8 15:54:29 mail postfix/smtpd[9334]: NOQUEUE: reject: RCPT from
unknown[59.183.54.228]: 554 : Recipient address
rejected: Access denied; from=

>From the log I can see that many mails are getting delivered to outside
domains without any problems. But the users who are getting the problem are
not able to send any mail to outside world. But these same users are able to
send mail to anyplace when they use IMAP. For web interface I am using
squirrelmail.

The book and practice seems to be out of phase :-)

It is simple to create new user(s). They are by default administrators (well, 
elevated rights), so that has to be fixed manually.

To: ""Weka machine learning workbench list.""

Content-Type: text/plain

Hi 

I am trying to classify a data set with 3 classes with the
Multilayerperceptron algorithm using the Weka data mining programm. I am
testing various parameter settings to see which one yields the best
results. I am experimenting with various learning rates, momentums and
delay on/off. So far most of the parameter combinations yielded good
results of around 85% correctly classified instances.

But every once in a while I find a combination of parameters where the
classification doesnt work at all and one (sometimes even two) class(es)
seems to be left out of the process and the confusion matrix looks like
the following:

a b c <-- classified as
0 6838 4 | a = '(-inf-0.25]'
0 6728 72 | b = '(0.25-0.75]'
0 2141 4952 | c = '(0.75-inf)'

I have not found a pattern in the parameters that causes this. 

What can be the reason for such behaviour?

David

However the same error persists.

http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/spam/

The active learning task will use a different version of the 
toolkit, to be available shortly.

The three tasks are:

On-line filtering with immediate feedback. 
- exactly the same task as for TREC 2005 and 2006

On-line filtering with delayed/incomplete/noisy feedback.
- same tools as for the TREC 2006 delayted feedback,
but the test data may not contain ""train"" commands
for every message, and some of the ""train"" commands
may be wrong so as to simulate user underreporting
and user error.

Emphasis will be placed on correct classification
of a large number of messages with no feedback.
(For example, there may be no feedback for the
last half of the messages)

On-line active filtering with active learning.
- different tools and task from TREC 2006 active learning
Filters will perform on-line classification as for the
other two tasks, but will be allowed to query the
true class (ham or spam) of a fraction of the messages,
chosen by the filter. This will be effected by an
additional command ""query"" added to the toolkit:

query 

where is a message previously classified
by the filter. 


Filters will be submitted to NIST (date to be determined, but
probably mid-July) after which a public corpus will be released.
Results on the public corpus will also be submitted to NIST
(probably late August).

We should use a remote SB classifier only when the network and classifier are trusted. When this is not the case we could do the parsing locally, hash the tokens, build the feature vector and send it to the remote classifier. This way the local application would not disclose sensitive information. Another important problem is related to using a single classifier for several application (possibly with a totally different content). IMHO the spam for an application might be totally different then the spam of another, or to be more exact: the ham/spam features might differ.

After you get the interface defined, I think that it should either 
become part of VMS.c or statically linked with it.

VMS.C is currently looking up and caching the values of several logical 
names. If those logical names are changed through VMS::LOGICAL then it 
may be desirable to update the value inside of VMS.C to match.

Special care is needed with the logical names that control C features, 
as it is an alternate method of controlling behavior.

We need to find out what happens if you create a logical name to change 
a feature to be different than what it was specifically set to using the 
decc$feature_*() api, and behave the same way in VMS.C

I may need this to make the ODS-5 handling work on older versions of VMS.

Thomas Ledbetter <htjdyuac@revelstone.net>,Postfix users <rljdsng-xyqoh@postfix.org>,2008-08-05 18:49:19,BCC mail 'storms',"Hi! Im wondering what advice anyone has regarding this issue:

When one of our users sends an email with a large amount of local
users listed in the BCC that contains a sizable attachment, it can
sometimes trigger a 'bcc storm'. 

We have a single F5 load balancer that various services flow through.
A single email transaction can 'loop' through one piece of equipment
multiple times. When one of these 'bcc storms' takes place, because of
this 'looping', it can max out the interfaces to the F5.

We've taken some measures to prevent this by reducing the number of
different types of services that pass through our load balancer, and
reverted to using RR DNS instead.

But Im wondering what else can be done. Taking a look at the q-shape
postfix readme, I see discussion regarding the
'default_destination_concurrency_limit' parameter which sounds
promising, but it affects *all* destinations.

It there any way to control concurrency limits on a per-host basis?",[],0,0

If he sent e-mail to me, my server would also reject it, then you would

I've installed the chipset software from Nvidia for my
motherboard hoping that this would fix the issue. 
I've installed realtek drivers to specifically try fix the
networking issue. Once they install I see no change on my device
management setup. no new network cards listed, just the standard
ieee1394 controller. 

My Other Pci Bridge Device and SM Bus Controller are still being
listed as other devices..

I'm going round in circles here and am at odds with reinstalling
vista just because I can't find the right driver. 

Vista is pretty, but clunky and a resource eating beast. I've
already forked out on extra RAM and at 2gb I've hit capacity for my
machine. (Thats not including the capacity I've added through ready
boost) 

I want XP (I never thought I'd hear myself say that)!

plus this stupid fucking italian keyboard is making everything
all the more infuriating...whats the point in me meditating when
technology is lurking round every corne to thwart my good will.

Dear Dr. Meyer



Bentham Science Publishers have gained a longstanding international
reputation for their excellent standards and top quality science
publications. Many journals published by Bentham Science Publishers have
received high impact factors in their respective fields. For the current
list of publications, please visit www.bentham.org. Seven Nobel Laureates
have endorsed a number of Bentham Science's journals; please read their
quotes at www.bentham.org/Nobel.htm 



The publishers are now undertaking a new publication venture by launching a
number of Open Access journals in 2007, devoted to various disciplines in
the fields of science and technology. 



Open Access Journals are freely accessible via the Internet for immediate
worldwide, open access to the full text of articles, serving the best
interests of the scientific community. All interested readers can read,
download and/or print open access articles at no cost. There is no
subscription fee for Open Access journals. The modest open access
publication costs are usually covered by the author's institution or
research funds. Moreover, authors who publish in our Open Access journals
retain the copyright of their article. Open Access journals are no different
from traditional subscription-based journals; they undergo the same
peer-review process and quality control as any other scholarly journal.



The Open Artificial Intelligence Journal is an Open Access online journal,
which publishes research articles, reviews and letters in all areas of
artificial intelligence. Please visit the journal's homepage and
Instructions for Authors for article submission at the following website
www.bentham.org/open/toaij 



The journal aims to provide the most complete and reliable source of
information on current developments in the field. The emphasis will be on
publishing quality articles rapidly and making them freely available to the
researchers worldwide. All published articles will be deposited immediately
upon publication in at least one widely and internationally recognized open
access repository. The published open access articles will be indexed by
Google and Google Scholar, thereby assuring their massive international
exposure. Moreover, similar to all open access publications, the articles
will also receive high citations.



The journal is essential reading for scientists and researchers who wish to
keep up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. The publishers
are confident of the journal's rapid success. 



In this connection, I would like to invite you to submit a research article,
review article or short communication/letter article to The Open Artificial
Intelligence Journal.



In case you are interested in submitting an article to this Open Access

Per,

I will be watching because as I already posted I see the ""exact"" same 
instability problems with my:

Gigabyte GA-N700SL
2 Gig of Ram
Raid1: 2 Seagate (ST3250410AS_6RY28WW1) SATA 250G drives in Raid 1
ATA: Maxtor_5T020H2_T2H34J2 as swap

I mean the *exact* same problems. Please do not forget to post any 
response you get from them. It also may be a kernel issue. Take a look 
at another bug I have open regarding this instability. The fact that it 
has spamassassin involved may be irrelevant. A Gigabyte,kernel issue may 
be the root cause:

I believe both versions work the same. The first account has admin
rights and many people don't go beyond that to create users with
restricted rights. They simply don't realize the difference between
admin and user. At least in Linux, at least SUSE, you get warnings
about running as root and you're expected to create a user during
install. With Ubuntu and some other distros, the first user is an admin
user, with rights to create a root password. Additional users are mere
mortals.

Too bad, I hoped that there is still the possibility to boot the installed

After reading the Wikipedia entries for the TLDs that they list as unused, I would be in 
favor of removing all of them

bv gb pm sj so um yt

If spammers can't use them as domains, then all including them could do would be to 
generate false positives.

The three listed as ""phaseout"", su tp yu, on the other hand, I would keep, because it 
appears from the Wikipedia articles that they are in active use either during a transition 
period or because their phaseout is being resisted.

If we can reach consensus on this, I'll make the changes to the code I committed.

yeah, exactly, that would be a good way to solve the problem.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

The Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS) invites participation in 
the CEAS Live Spam Challenge. Participants will compete in filtering a 
live 24-hour e-mail stream delivered using standard protocols (SMTP, 
IMAP4, POP3). All types of anti-spam technology are welcome including 
servers, appliances, proxies and personal filters. Participants will be 
allowed to use any network resource including real-time blacklists, 
real-time white-lists, reverse-DNS queries, and privately owned and 
updated databases.

Simulated user-feedback will be provided to train learning-based 
filters. Filters will be evaluated based on a weighted combination of 
the percentage of spam blocked and its false positive percentage.

The challenge will be held in conjunction with the Fourth Annual 
Conference on Email and Anti-Spam (CEAS). Conference registration and 
attendance is not required for participation.

Please see http://www.ceas.cc/challenge for competition details and 
instructions on joining the competition e-mail list.

Does MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING mean the rename over an existing file is actually
atomic? I cannot find any MSDN docs that say so (and I've seen some that
suggest to me that it probably isn't).

If it's not atomic, then this doesn't offer any advantage over shutil.move that
I can see (and in fact would damage the usefulness of os.rename, which is
currently atomic on all platforms AFAIK, even though it cannot succeed all the
time).

If MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING miraculously turns out to be atomic, then my
opinion is:

* this feature would be very useful, and I would like a cross-platform way to
do this in Python.
* this feature should not be called ""os.rename"", which for years has done
something else on some platforms, and so changing it will invite unnecessary
breakage. A new function would be better, or perhaps an optional flag. I
propose ""os.atomic_rename"".

Also, I assume this cannot replace files that are in use?

I'd be ok with a flag, but it should have a cross-platform name.
""require_atomic"" or ""replace"" or something like that. I think a new function
makes more sense, though.

I don't quite follow what you're saying here, but I'd be against an operation
called ""rename"" that sometimes was atomic and sometimes wasn't.

Does MoveFileEx solve the atomicity problem that Guido raised in that thread? I
don't think it does, so I think the situation is still the same.

But wait, you're almost there! The only thing you need is a sed script to
convert the utf-8 symbols to groff_char(7) gibberish, right?

Something like
utf2groff

#!/bin/sed -f

# Convert utf 8 to groff_char(7)

You hit the ""reject"" action because:

- The SMTP client IP address 59.183.54.228 is not in mynetworks

- AND wr.ceatfin.com is not in mydestination, virtual_alias_domains or
virtual_maibox_domains.

I tried to implement the %^H approach, but I could work out how to set/get %^H
in C code in way that actually achieved the right effect.

I tried implementing the warnings approach by having C (and above)
do C ;
in the same way that C does C
but I got a test failure in t/op/reg_namedcapture.t

I attach the guts of the later patch, in case someone can work out what is wrong.
The simplest failure is 
% env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=1 ./perl -Ilib -e 'keys %!'
Assertion he->shared_he_he.hent_hek == hek failed: file ""hv.c"", line 2257 during global destruction.

Any suggestions welcome.

That I wouldn't bet on, but spamassassins kids are running as gene, called

It figures, Joanne would have to see how long she can balance on the soap 
box. ;-) At least here in Weston, our 'free speech stump', the stump of a 4+ 
foot diameter Grand Old Man that was here & probably 50 feet tall when the 
war between the states was a current event, has a guard rail now, and since 
they left it about 4 feet tall, has a set of steps so even an old fart like 
me can make it up onto it should I feel the urge to make a speech.

However, I see what you are saying, both about perms, and locations. 
Excellent points, I'll see what I can figure out toward making that database 
belong to me instead of root. Obviously I didn't carry that conversion to 
user near far enough, so I deserve the knuckle rap.

How about I change that kmail filter rule to use:
runcon -l gene sa-learn --spam /path/to/spam
and:
runcon -l gene sa-learn --ham /path/to/ham

Now, I note that the /home/gene/.spamassassin/bayes* stuff is carrying a very

My question was about Vista. My ThinkPad came with XP Home and I have

Stan Goodman <riwe.tvpfdwv@hashkedim.com>,wkilxloc@opensuse.org,2008-08-06 2:35:19,[opensuse] openSUSE and faxes,"I would like to be able to send and receive faxes using my openSUSE v10.3 
system. A bit of looking around showed that there are not many 
applications to do this -- actually only one, HylaFax, which I thought 
likely to be more capable than the combination of sendfax+mgetty, I have 
downloaded and installed HylaFax.

Surprisingly, HylaFax does not sport a GUI, as far as I have been able to 
discover. I find it difficult to believe that many people, having 
acquired a sophisticated operating system like SuSE, will be content with 
command-line operation, so I have to wonder if I have overlooked another 
available application. What do people do for fax service in SuSE? Or do 
only few people use this OS for faxing?

I have stumbled upon a Java app that is intended to be a GUI for HylaFax. 
This is SUSEFax, which seems to be the product of someone at SuSE in 
Germany. It was first released in 1997 (sic), but is also available in a 
later beta (v1.0beta3) dated 1999, even for x86_64 at RPM.PBONE.NET.

It is labeled src.rpm for SuSE v9. Before I get into compiling it 
(something I have not done so far), I would like to ask some questions 
about it. 

The 1997 webpage says that the docs are in German only. A later user wrote 
on a forum that the 1999 release has English docs, but all the labels in 
the GUI are in German (a decade after first release, and still in beta). 
Does anyone have later information? Has the developer recovered a desire 
to finish what he started? The program shouts ""Half-Done Abandonware""

Fax apps on other OSes make the sending operation a matter of ""printing"" 
from the application that created the document to the fax app; does 
SUSEfax do that? This is not mentioned in any of the webpages I have 
found. It is said only that one can send faxes from the phone book. So at 
minimum, there are at least two stages in sending a fax.

The HylaFax webpage speaks of the need for Ghostscript. What is this for? 
Since faxes arrive in raster form, not as either ASCII codes or 
Postscript formatting information, what does Ghostscript have to 
contribute to the fax function?

*
Current Committee Vacancies - Get on board!!*

There are currently a few positions available. If you are interested, 
please contact Anneka Vuletich 421-0919 in the first instance.

*_President_* (Approximately three hours per month)
This involves setting the agenda for the monthly meetings and
running them, writing the president's blurb that appears in the
newsletter each month, and general support of committee.

_*Vice President*_
VP is currently unfilled. It is a support role to President and would
include assisting with committee meetings and upcoming events.
It would probably average about two hours per month.

*_Antenatal Packs_ *(three hours per month)
Ordering and photocopying pamphlets as required. You are required to 
make up two packs per couple for each antenatal course and you need the 
space to store two large containers.

_*Antenatal Leader*_
Remember your antenatal class? The person who set up and helped “glue” 
the class together? Want to emulate her? This is a paid position if one 
person will do all the classes to provide consistency. There is 
currently a total of seven per year. Otherwise, if you’re thinking of 
adding to your family or just want an antenatal update – volunteer as a 
Leader for one course (seven Wednesday nights).

*_Newsletter Editor_ *(five hours plus every second month_)_
Collate material for this newsletter from other committee members and 
own topics. All advertising is supplied by the advertising co-ordinator. 
The newsletter is currently formatted in Microsoft Publisher.

_*Baby & You Course Convener*_

There are six Baby and You courses booked for 2008. This is a very 
critical role as Baby and You forms part of the core course that HBC 
Parents Centre promotes.
It may be possible for two people to run this course.
The tasks include:
Set up in week one and pack down in week five
Booking venue – Whangaparaoa library
Confirming speakers
Making sure that speakers are paid on time
A Saturday CPR course - one per course
Reviewing course evaluations
Making sure that accurate statistics are kept
Organising hosts to assist in the following Baby and You course",0,0,0

Editor's Note


Prizes and Awards: It's That Time of Year


'Tis the season for prizes, or so it seems anyway. For starters, Edmund M. Clarke, E. Allen Emerson, and Joseph Sifakis received the 2007 Turing Award, the granddaddy of all computing awards, for their work on model checking, an automated technique for finding design errors in complex hardware and software. They share a $250,000 prize.
Moving from computing to mathematics, Pierre Deligne, Phillip Griffiths, and David Mumford are sharing the 2008 Wolf Foundation Prize in Mathematics. Deligne was honored ""for his work on mixed Hodge theory, the Weil conjectures, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, and for his contributions to arithmetic,"" Griffiths ""for his work on variations of Hodge structures; the theory of periods of abelian integrals; and for his contributions to complex differential geometry,"" and Mumford ""for his work on algebraic surfaces; on geometric invariant theory; and for laying the foundations of the modern algebraic theory of moduli of curves and theta functions."" The three share a $100,000 award.
This year's Crafoord Prize combined the fields of abstract mathematics with astrophysics. Maxim Kontsevich and Edward Witten received the 2008 Crafoord Prize in Mathematics from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, while Rashid Sunyaev received the Crafoord Prize in Astronomy. Kontsevich and Witten were cited ""for their important contributions to mathematics inspired by modern theoretical physics."" Half of the $500,000 prize goes to Kontsevich and Witten, the other half to Sunyaev.
Back in the field of computing, the 2007 Gordon Bell Prize went to a team of scientists--Kyle Caspersen, James Glosli, John Gunnels, David Richards, Robert Rudd, and Frederick Streitz--from Lawrence Livermore National Lab and IBM for a unique simulation of a phenomenon known as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the BlueGene/L. These gents will divvy up a $10,000 prize.
And finally, there's the Dr. Dobb's Excellence In Programming Award, given this year to....uh, I can't tell you. It is still a secret. But the recipient will be honored in the upcoming April 2008 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal and in person at the SD West 2008 Conference on Wednesday, March 5, 2008. For a list of previous recipients, visit Dr. Dobb's Hall of Fame. 
Congratulations to one and all for well-deserved honors.

Don't speculate. Measure. In this case, you need a packet capture to

I know aliases works but what about but I would really like to forward 
all mail from all users and services, new and old, to automatically 
forward to a central e-mail server which will deliver the account mail

You hit the ""reject"" action because:

- The SMTP client IP address 59.183.54.228 is not in mynetworks

- AND wr.ceatfin.com is not in mydestination, virtual_alias_domains or
virtual_maibox_domains.

- AND the SMTP client is not SASL authenticated.

You can simplify the above access rules as follows:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
permit_mynetworks,
permit_sasl_authenticated,
reject_unauth_destination,

"""SearchStorage.com"" <vbadpnbtgumjq@lists.techtarget.com>",user6@gvc.ceas-challenge.cc,2008-08-05 23:58:24,New White Paper: Why Virtual Servers Need Virtual Storage,"Dear SearchStorage.com member,

The flexibility provided by virtualization introduces several
challenges and places a burden on storage. If your servers are
virtualized, but your storage is still physically attached, you
haven't improved much. 

This white paper explains how virtual SAN storage with automatic load
balancing can provide flexible and fluid virtualization
implementation. Read this white paper to discover: 

** Considerations when selecting virtualization technologies 
** The importance of iSCSI when enabling virtual machines to be on
a SAN
** A checklist for evaluating a Virtual Server/Virtual Storage 
solution

Your parents are lucky.

In Iraq, we had XP machines on a Department of Defence SECURE
NETWORK which was completely cut off from the rest of the
internet, and they STILL caught viruses.

We need to break the back of the mandatory bundling of Windows.
Personally, I think computers sold retail should be have line-item
costs, with Windows as a separate cost from the hardware.

It's just like payroll taxes deducted out of the paycheck --
what people don't have to explicitly fork over extra money
for, they soon forget (if they were ever aware of it in
the first place).",[],0,0

iybz@pobox.com,bsfegmjrr-hnq@python.org,2008-08-05 19:36:11,[spambayes-dev] SpamBayes core_server.py and related bits merged to CVS HEAD,"I just merged the code for a new application, core_server.py, to the
SpamBayes CVS HEAD. When I checked in the changes on HEAD I got a bunch of
messages like this:

cvs diff: Tag 1.1 refers to a dead (removed) revision in file `core_server.py'.
cvs diff: No comparison available. Pass `-N' to `cvs diff'?

It looks like the checkin actually worked, but I've never seen that message
before.

This new application, scripts/core_server.py, is fundamentally the same as
the preexisting POP3 proxy, but uses a simple plugin scheme to support
different protocol adapters. The only plugin written so far is spambayes/
XMLRPCPlugin.py, which, as you might guess, allows messages to be scored
using XML-RPC calls. There are two methods, score and score_mime. The
latter is pretty much what we are used to - essentially shoot an email (or
email-like) message over the pipe and get a score back. The former method
(maybe it should be named score_form) accepts a dictionary representing a
form submission, a set of extra tokens generated by the client (such as was
the submission from an anonymous user?) and a set of attachments. The last
two args can be empty (though because of XML-RPC constraints they can't be
optional.)

The first application of this is likely to the the new Roundup-based Python
tracker. I wrote a simple Roundup auditor for that purpose today. I'll be
testing that over the next few days. The second application will likely be
MoinMoin. Marian Neagul is doing a Google Summer of Code project on page
classification which this might fit into nicely. In theory, an web site can
use it though as long as it can speak XML-RPC.

BTW, before I merged I created a tag, BEFORE_CORESVR_MERGE. I also created
an AFTER_CORESVR_MERGE tag after the big checkin. Can people give the
existing applications a whirl to make sure I didn't break anything?

For Reimar and Marian (the MoinMoin gurus), I did a very little bit of
performance testing. Roundtrip performance on my laptop (Mac PowerBook G4 -
800MHz) with both the server and client running on the same machine ranged
anywhere from 10-50 bytes/ms. When I added a large payload (a MIME encoded
JPEG file of 9.5MB) performance in terms of bytes/ms shot way up, but as you
would imagine overall time did as well. Here are some figures:

attachment time bytes/ms
size
9587824 30.7 sec 312
975978 3.7 sec 259
114794 0.5 sec 252

If spammers can't use them as domains, then all including them could do would be to 
generate false positives.

The three listed as ""phaseout"", su tp yu, on the other hand, I would keep, because it
